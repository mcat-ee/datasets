For decades, roughly from 1950-1970, until its banning by US-government, it was used and researched by psychiatrists and medical doctors with very positive outcomes. It was used to heal depression, anxiety (for example of the terminal ill) and to beat addictions. The original alcoholics anonymous healing plan involved taking LSD in good set and setting! Beside medicinal use, LSD enriched the lives of many people both artistically and spiritually, see the Beatles, Jimmy Hendrix and Aldous Huxley (Brave New World). Others were scientifically inspired: The PCR method in biology (Worth the Nobel Price) was, so says its inventor, explicitly found with the use of LSD! Steve Jobs said the LSD-experience was one of the most important experiences of his live.  Never did anybody die directly from an LSD overdose.  There is no scientific basis for a strict ban of LSD and I am happy that an increasing amount of people use legal LSD-analogs like 1P-LSD ( www.1plsd.to) and that it is increasingly discussed in media (Bill maher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqAZ_7nBHS8 ) and science (PNAS: http://www.pnas.org/content/113/17/4853.full ) Just wanted to get this off my chest,  Thank you", "threadId": "702775890"}, {"teaser": "Trapthread?

Basically a couple of my med-fag female friends went away for 4 weeks to a rural hospital to do their rotation there.

When they came back to visit me over the weekend, they started talking about one of the dudes (I&#039;ll call him Jacob) from our hospital who went over to the rural hospital as well.  They would say things like &#039;Oh, Jacob says the funniest things, he&#039;s so witty, he&#039;s so cute, blah blah blah&#039;.  Then one of them turns to me, her eyes light up and is all like &#039;Anon! Are you jealous?!?&#039; XD. The expression on my face had not changed markedly before this, nor was I questioning them in great detail about him.  I&#039;m just like sitting there thinking &#039;wtf? We&#039;re friends and she&#039;s asking me if I&#039;m jealous&#039;.  She later explained that she meant that I was jealous that he is now their friend as well. But even in that context, asking me if I&#039;m jealous that they have a new male friend makes no sense... right? Considering she has other male friends too.  So about a week later when she comes back again, I decide to tease her and say &#039;So how is your new bf Jacob going?&#039;. She immediately gets excited and blurts out &#039;ANON!! Are you threatened?!?&#039;  Similar thing again happened on facebook. I made a comment like that and she accuses me of being jealous. And her other two friends start laughing and going &#039;N&#039;AWWWW&#039;  Keep in mind that I have a gf that she knows about too.  So what do you think. The fuck does she think about me??

I split town because I didn&#039;t want to hurt one of the people involved. I ended up being chased and harrassed through AZ, NM, TX, MO and KS until a deputy of the Anderson County, KS Sheriff&#039;s Department pulled me over for no reason, cuffed me for no reason, then led me around the side of his vehicle and started leading me away from his vehicle. He ended up throwing me on the ground and slamming his knee into my temple with his full weight twice. I had called 911 as I was being pulled over because of the crazy things that had been happening to me to make sure it was a legitimate pullover. A cop from a neighboring jurisdiction showed up just as the Deputy put his hand on his pistol. The Deputy changed his entire demeanor afterwards. There have been a lot of things to happen to me since in IL, IN, and KS since then. I don&#039;t know why these things have been happening.

Gambling: I\u2019d always thought my 7/10 girlfriend\u2019s biggest flaw was her gambling problem. Worst example; the week before we moved in (i.e. deposit paid) she got drunk and gambled away the last \u00a32k of her savings. Smoking: I knew she was a smoker, but I didn&#039;t know she was a heavy smoker, 15-20 cigs a day. Drinking: She wouldn&#039;t drink whole bottles when we were together, even for whole weekends and week-long holidays, she hid her heavy drinking. Employment: She has an office job and her drinking doesn\u2019t affect her work yet, as she currently only drinks at night.  Education: Not a Feminazi or (total) Libtard despite studying English Literature, Religious studies, Film studies &amp; Women\u2019s studies in College.  Trauma: Her ex-fianc\u00e9e drank a lot and encouraged her too, they had a surprise pregnancy, 6 months in she had a miscarriage, the coward emptied the apartment of his stuff and bailed while she was recovering in hospital, he never returned her calls. &gt;I love her for all the reasons that aren&#039;t listed above.

You&#039;ll probably get high with friends, laugh extremely hard for no reason, &quot;trip out&quot; in total confusion and general euphoria. This is especially true if you have good (dank) weed. Eventually the high will dull and dull no matter what you do. This is called tolerance. Your daily smoker friend telling you he got &quot;so high&quot; off a few puffs of a joint is just lying to himself. After a year or two of even taking one bong hit per weekend with friends, the novelty of weed will wear off. Eventually two kinds of people emerge after this period: Person A will realize weed isn&#039;t DUDE LMAO like it was at the beginning and they will move on with their lives without it. Person B will become addicted psychologically to the &quot;best feeling ever&quot; from weed and probably transition to a daily smoker. Some versions of Person B will go to work, come home every day and shut themselves up in their apartments smoking and generally being antisocial. Do not become Person B, because you will form a dependence on weed to feel normal and that is where the addiction happens. A person who has been smoking weed for years doesn&#039;t get high. Most daily smokers try everything to up their high like oils, hash, dabs etc, but though taking a more powerful dose nothing will recapture the original dozen times of smoking herb.

All have sinned and therefore cannot enter into Heaven on their own accord Isaiah 53:6, \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; Romans 3:23, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d  Romans 3:10, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d 2. There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3. Jesus lived a sinless life and shed his blood on the cross so we could be forgiven. John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d", "threadId": "702813941"}, {"teaser": "Is 2016 and I still don&#039;t know how the &quot;game&quot; in this video was made, enlighten me /b/", "threadId": "702813961"}, {"teaser": "616 thread?", "threadId": "702814033"}, {"teaser": "Alright /b/ I&#039;ve been talking to this girl, I really like her.

I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don&#039;t become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you&#039;re not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you&#039;re good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you&#039;re finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It&#039;s an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city.", "threadId": "702825912"}, {"teaser": "Moar like dis", "threadId": "702825916"}, {"teaser": "MY EX WANTS TO GET BACK WITH ME????

Put in contact details etc, don&#039;t exceed the price amount of \u00a319 (I think?) or it will charge. 7. Delivery is \u00a33, stuffed crust is \u00a32.50 and isn&#039;t with the deal.

So on Saturday my dog wouldn&#039;t eat anything and had a bought of vomiting and then some diarrhea, and the diarrhea got significantly worse through the day, coming out like a soda fountain. Later on that night I saw blood in his poop. My father and I ended up bringing him to the ER that night, they gave him fluids under his skin and medicine to take home. We brought him home but it just got worse, more diarrhea and more blood. In the morning we brought him back and I honestly thought that was it; he was so lethargic and there was so much blood coming out. We left him there for hospitalization.  Things got better and we went to visit him on Monday. He was walking and drinking water but not really eating. Today we brought him home, really just about 3 hours ago and I am so worried that he&#039;s not going to get better or just start bleeding again. He&#039;s only 5 years old and I love this dog so much. I don&#039;t have any friends aside from some people I talk to at the gym and he&#039;s my best friend.

For the last ten years I suffered from severe persistent neurological pain from exposure when I was working as a petroleum worker, this also manifested itsef into other disabilities mental deficits and severe depression. I had been put on Oxycodones/ Vicodins by my former doctors and soon found myself addicted with no way to stop, eventually being told by the same doctor to get on suboxones, and when I couldn&#039;t afford those I went to the next logical step: Buying illegal street drugs. A naturopath I went to when I was contemplating suicide recommended a plant called Kratom. At the time it was little known, and there was limited sources so I scoured the earth until I came to a middle eastern market and bought 100gr of the stuff for $50 (more than a month supply) I went home and took it instead of the vicodins and felt immense relief. So much so it made me break into tears. The pain was incredibly diminished but the slow narcotic feeling poisoned was gone. I was able to walk and move without being sickly and disoriented or feelings of excruciating pain. In addition it intensely relieved the severe depression I had for years. This plant as of the 30th is being banned and made Schedule I. As a result I am being forced to get off of this indxpensive herb and buy street drugs again or go back to the same doctors who got me hooked. I beg of you to please email or contact the DEA and local politicians. This will destroy me and make me dead broke again and suicidal just when my life was making a turn for the better.

By virtue of her passing out her consent was withdrawn because at that moment in time she became incapable of acting freely or voluntarily nor was she capable of exercising free will (Cal. Penal Code \u00a7261.6). That&#039;s sexual assault by virtue of Cal. Penal Code \u00a7289(d)(1) because the victim was at the time unconscious of the nature of the defendant&#039;s act by reason of her being unconscious/asleep, and this was known to the defendant at the time. Further, the statements in pic related overlook the fact that the defendant was seen by witnesses laying on top of the victims motionless body, with her and his pants pulled down. The defendant, upon realising he was being watched, tried to run, possibly out of fear. The fact is the victim was unconscious with circumstantial evidence corroborating the witnesses allegations that the defendant was on top of the victim with both of their pants pulled down. Pine needles were also found on the victim&#039;s and defendant&#039;s crotch area. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve cited the sections in the Cal.

She cried uncontrollably, every sob, every whimper, forever boring deeper into my soul. Like the ghostly voice of a child I had just killed. Every moment making me want to escape the room, the house, the country, the planet, the everything. The root of my anguish being that the girl I broke up with and the girl I fell in love with were the same, but it was the girl she was in between I couldn&#039;t stand to be around anymore. It was as if a demon had killed her and invaded her body, to tortured me. In my mind I&#039;m reminded of how she would complain and accuse, the faces she would make when I didn&#039;t get everything just right. Yet all I wanted to see was her smile. However I came to realize that it would by my words that the light in her eyes would be snuffed out. I can still remember how I would meet her half way between the train station and my dorm when we first started dating. The snow would fall from the dark sky, and we&#039;d be so happy when we saw each other. The kisses and the laughter, how she grasped my arm as we walked together, it still torments me to this day. Not a day goes by without thinking about her; without mourning her. To this day, walking along on a snowy night, it is almost as if I can see her come towards me.
