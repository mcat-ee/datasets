She told me she has a boyfriend and they were dating for about 4 years now, and she was telling me that she is very unhappy because her current boyfriend is very abusive towards her. I started investigating on this, but not a lot, didn&#039;t know how serious it was. This night was extremely hard. We went to the club again, she came as well (without her bf because he is banned from the club). The bf was worried that B might cheat on him with one of us, so he sent his boys to look for him. Note, apparently he is extremely dangerous, he has a gang of other crewmates that really did bad stuff. Now this night, she was dancing with another co-worker, it was a friendly dance, but B&#039;s bf friends thought it was more serious, so when everyone left, she pretty much got kidnapped by her bf and his friends into his car (she was saying that she will get proper beat up) When me and my other 2 mates saw what happened, we got into our own car and we started following it down. Luckily the police thought we were drunk and driving, so they followed us as well. At a car park we stopped and told the officers what is happening. They came with us, but they couldnt do much at that moment, B when in the police&#039;s car and stood there while they left, in the meantime we were parked 10 feet away. B&#039;s boyfriend took her wallet and keys, so I let her crash around mine.

Over the past few months, he has continued to inform me that this was &quot;the funniest, most outrageous website&quot; he has seen. I favoured this, because, my son has only one friend and had always seemed terribly miserable. After he visited this site, he started to become happier. That is, until last month when his actions then started turning dark and evil. 18th of March, I caught him masturbating to these underage e-sluts over the Internet. I couldn&#039;t believe it, my son, who is much too young for sex is playing with the devil. A few weeks later on the 29th of March I find Charles wrapping Cre (our family cat) in toilet paper and attempting to set the toilet paper on fire. As of Tuesday, which has finally concluded my search for his X-factor contributing to his actions lead me here. I come home to find my son Charles, skipped school, and in the bathroom I find poor Cre&#039;s head in the toilet and his body set on fire, I was HORRIFIED. He tells me that &quot;4chan&quot; showed him these things. I immediately search this particular board, as he tells me this is the only side he has visited and what I find are the most EVIL of sins here. Upon my first few searches, I find such sickening Child Pornography and foul pictures of women with surgically attached penises onto themselves. As of my search yesterday, I find these HORRENDOUS photos of animals mutilated, decapitated, mauled, abused, and set on fire. I had to stop there as I started to heave up my lunch. This site has permanently punctured my son&#039;s mind, and I WILL be taking further action through the Internet officials .

Approximately 40% of all manmade CO2 is successfully absorbed by the environment. This means roughly 60% of manmade CO2 is not absorbed and thus increases atmospheric CO2. We may therefore say we need to reduce global CO2 production by around 60% to reach a break even point - but this ignores the fact that absorption rises along with our production. Still, something around this number can be found in the scientific research. &quot;In order to stabilize CO2 concentrations at about 450 ppm by 2050, global emissions would have to decline by about 60%. Industrialized countries greenhouse gas emissions would have to decline by about 80%.&quot; according to Barack Obama&#039;s Presidential Climate Action Plan 80% - And all our proposed plans (if fully executed) would reduce emissions by less than 5%. The United States accounts for about 17% of manmade CO2. Japan, 4%. Korea, 2%. European nations between 1 and 2 percent each. China and the developing world account for over 47% of manmade CO2. So if you wiped out all of the US, all of Europe, Japan, and Korea, and then managed to reduce China by around 25%, you would be near the break even point for CO2 absorption. Perhaps you start to see now what we are actually facing here. A 60% global reduction in CO2 cannot be accomplished without creating a worldwide economic depression which would no doubt kill millions of human beings.

It was a big job. The biggest. And even though my gut was turning summersaults I knew I couldn&#039;t turn it down. This was the kind of slicing gig that would make a hundred reputations or destroy a thousand more. Her father was the head of the Dole banana conglomerate and some Ivy League poindexter came up with the big idea to do the annual customer gala with a casino night theme. But this time they were gunna use banana chips instead of poker chips.

Would you not agree that the universe has a &quot;pulse&quot; of energy? Our entire ecosystem siphons energy off from the sun. That energy in its rawest form is undoubtedly connecting us all to the entire universe. There is no energy that can&#039;t be traced back to the beginning. Therefor, rather than this force &quot;interacting&quot; with matter, the matter is literally a part of the universe, and thus that force itself. All forms of energy whether kinetic or chemical still contribute the the total constructs of our reality. I wont dive too far into time, but I think we can all agree that our reality is governed by an energy force that remains constant.  My point was, the exact energy that makes us alive, the energy that fires synapses and makes a heart beat, (not just the chemical aspect) is that same raw form of energy that gives the universe a pulse. Are bodies are therefor just &quot;lenses&quot; for that energy to create consciousness. Once the energy is in our bodies, our consciousness is local, but as for the energy itself, it remains a non local constant force.  Buddhists refer to Buddha as &quot;one with the universe&quot;. Although it may be speculation, I think the &quot;Buddha&quot; state is simply the consciousness of the universe, and these monks a few thousand years ago realized that they could connect with the grand non-local consciousness by stripping themselves of ego. Similar instances in Christianity can be the &quot;holy spirit&quot;  If you analyze the behavior of proteins and dna, you see that incredibly complex information is being conveyed on a micro scale. Like a hive mind, these microscopic building blocks work together to construct something they have no possible way of comprehending or perceiving on an individual scale. instead they simply exist 100% objectively.

I froze in that moment when I realized my cat was already inside, and it brushed up against my leg. Then from out of the woods came a disfigured man with long extended legs and arms, and a wound on his chest with blood dripping out. It made its way towards my front door.

When i got home, i washed my hands thoroughly and started to paint my nails (they were almost 2 cm in length since i planned this since august). after i let the nails dry, i washed my hands and used the shaving cream, and razor and wax to ensure that all the hair on my hands were gone and rubbed lotion to make my hands look shiny and more feminine. i found a website online that does text to speech and there was an option for a girl voice. i just typed in things for it to say in random time intervals like &quot;you&#039;re a naughty boy&quot; &quot;don&#039;t cum yet Anon&quot; &quot;my pussy lusts for your big, hard cock&quot; &quot;if you cum, i&#039;ll get angry&quot; etc.. i got my phone and a tripod set up on my bedframe. while laying down on my bed, i started fapping while playing the text to speech pretty loud so my phone camera could pick it up. the video from my phone shows a perspective where it seems like im getting a hand job from a business like woman (which is i guess kind of my fetish) while im trying not to cum with precum all over my stomach and legs. immediately after, i washed myself in the shower and removed the nail polish so people don&#039;t look at me funny on the streets on how im a guy with nail polish (im not a faggot). now i fap every single day to this video because it makes me pretend that i actually got a handjob from a real girl even though im a virgin at 24. I literally cannot get hard anymore unless I paint my nails with polish. could some of you /b/ros help me out so i could make a better faux experience of getting a blowjob or actual sex with things from the pharmacy? just watching this video of me getting a handjob is good and all, but i dont want just a handjob", "threadId": "702709339"}, {"teaser": "My rifle in the pelican case  Show us yours", "threadId": "702709374"}, {"teaser": "What is the point in buying an overpriced piece of tech if it&#039;s so locked down?", "threadId": "702709391"}, {"teaser": "Black Girl Thread!", "threadId": "702709409"}, {"teaser": "Pics you shouldn&#039;t share and girls you saved", "threadId": "702709425"}, {"teaser": "What&#039;s YOUR excuse for not having tried acid yet?", "threadId": "702709433"}, {"teaser": "What&#039;s up faggots?

Lawns noticed I was with her and I tried showing her attention too, but I just wanted to be with Els, so I went back with her, later on whilst listening to some music I decided to kiss Els, it went on for a bit, but ended up with her crying to her mate about how she doesn&#039;t know if she likes me back, and how she still loves her ex I went off on my own for a bit and took some mdma which for some reason made me depressed as fuck, I opened up to Els and said that I like her way too much for how much I know her, and how I want to do all this stuff with her, and she was telling me about how she still loved her ex..  Me having this talk with Els, lead to Lawns not wanting to talk to me, so I feel like I&#039;ve made the right choice by telling the girl I think I love how I feel, and by not stringing along a girl I don&#039;t love, but why do I feel like it&#039;s all a mistake?", "threadId": "702715698"}, {"teaser": "Lets start a Rekt Thread", "threadId": "702715712"}, {"teaser": "Doesn&#039;t anyone have recent Snapchat stories from Kendra Sunderland?

Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d", "threadId": "702717716"}, {"teaser": "How does one stop being so anxious (without drugs)?

She&#039;s got a boyfriend. Now, as I have previously stated, I have a very low opinion of myself, tho I mask it well. Why? Because I know I shouldn&#039;t. I&#039;m tall, doin well in med school, I lift and have had succesfull relationships before. And yet, I can&#039;t think to highly of myself.

Thin, scrawny, fetal alcohol syndrome- like face, short, ill mannered, dumb... No, I&#039;m not being salty. I fucking grilled the guy. He actually thinks we&#039;re friends. So, the ole pathetic me is god-mode compared to this shit, and she picks him over me. She damn well fucking knows I have a thing for her ever since we met, 3 fucking years ago. And then, the clock strikes 0, right? The big celebration. While we were singing Happy Birthday, she gets this lil cunt next to her and gives him a nice, passionate kiss... while making eye contact with me. And only me. One full minute of her staring at me while she was kissing another guy. And all I could do is sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. Not gonna lie, I cried a bit when I got home. The frustration was too much. So, in a single night, a girl broke my heart, made me cry for the first time in a long time, and effectively crushed any and all motivation I had.

We had met on Okcupid to begin with and had a really successful relationship (2 yr) with outlook on a long future for us.  She had deleted her old account a while back but made this new one. Things she lied to me about: &gt;told me she wasn&#039;t actively looking for relationships and other people &gt;told me there has been no flirting going on between her or others (receiving or giving) &gt;and today i confronted her about her account and she lied about her using it to match up with people (made fake accnt, catfished to know this) We talked and i discovered that it was made out of boredom/curiosity and so on, without intention of pursuing IRL meets despite her profile saying she was looking for friends and short term relationships. But she was a very active user and even had the phone app She&#039;s obviously way more in the wrong than me here even though her intentions were not devious. Having stumbled on her profile given that she had sent me an Okcupid article the day before, I made a fake account and discovered all of the shit she wrote on her profile/in her q &amp; a and so on and it was very unsettling. Given, if you want to grab attention/have fun with it/get that ego boost or just waste time, filling out the questions does meet that and it also acts in matching you with similar interests across the board. So now we talked about most of it and i directly confronted her over skype, she was both defensive at times and guilty/sad. I made sure she knew that the core issue was that she blatantly lied to me when we agreed on transparency, and i made sure she knew the grief this caused me the past few days. She wrote to me before sleeping saying that she &quot;doesnt know whether we can properly come back from this&quot; and that she &quot;just cant help this sinking feeling&quot; fr the scenario", "threadId": "702733164"}, {"teaser": "Faces of /b/ and rate/judge each other", "threadId": "702733187"}, {"teaser": "Cringe thread", "threadId": "702733192"}, {"teaser": "Whoever tf messaged his mother, keep it going, dubs decide maybe?", "threadId": "702733220"}, {"teaser": "Just get in here faggots.

Over the past few months, he has continued to inform me that this was &quot;the funniest, most outrageous website&quot; he has seen. I favoured this, because, my son has only one friend and had always seemed terribly miserable. After he visited this site, he started to become happier. That is, until last month when his actions then started turning dark and evil. 18th of March, I caught him masturbating to these underage e-sluts over the Internet.

Over the past few months, he has continued to inform me that this was &quot;the funniest, most outrageous website&quot; he has seen. I favoured this, because, my son has only one friend and had always seemed terribly miserable. After he visited this site, he started to become happier. That is, until last month when his actions then started turning dark and evil. 18th of March, I caught him masturbating to these underage e-sluts over the Internet. I couldn&#039;t believe it, my son, who is much too young for sex is playing with the devil. A few weeks later on the 29th of March I find Charles wrapping Cre (our family cat) in toilet paper and attempting to set the toilet paper on fire. As of Tuesday, which has finally concluded my search for his X-factor contributing to his actions lead me here. I come home to find my son Charles, skipped school, and in the bathroom I find poor Cre&#039;s head in the toilet and his body set on fire, I was HORRIFIED. He tells me that &quot;4chan&quot; showed him these things. I immediately search this particular board, as he tells me this is the only side he has visited and what I find are the most EVIL of sins here. Upon my first few searches, I find such sickening Child Pornography and foul pictures of women with surgically attached penises onto themselves. As of my search yesterday, I find these HORRENDOUS photos of animals mutilated, decapitated, mauled, abused, and set on fire. I had to stop there as I started to heave up my lunch. This site has permanently punctured my son&#039;s mind, and I WILL be taking further action through the Internet officials .

For more than a year now I&#039;ve been spending more time at their placethan mine. Couple of my closest college friends are /b/tards as well. However, I&#039;ve recently been offered to join a small fraternity chapter by friends that used to know a while back. The frat President told me that since they know me so well I would not have to go through the process of becoming a brother and can just jump straight into becoming a member. One of my best friends says that this is a great opportunity and that he will also join if I do. My roommate is from that frat too, and I just had this conversation with him that pretty much enlightened me on how frats really are. These faggots apparently do &quot;national salutes&quot; and shit, and while the chapter only has 6 members, they all spend a shitton of time with each other and have to do all these bullshit meetings. My /b/tard friend told me that I shouldn&#039;t join, mainly because being in a frat feels like you&#039;re buying friends, and that I already have a social circle. This is a typical venturing out of the comfort zone moment for me, and I honestly don&#039;t know what to do. Do I stay with my friend circle?

What sports do you play, other than \u201cjack off to naked drawn Japanese people\u201d? I also get straight A\u2019s, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; Shit was SO cash).

I particulary have a interest in how everyone has their own mental perception of everyday things, for example when i think of a certain memory and how it made me feel, it has its own specific identity that you cant confuse with any other memory, not because the content, but because how it specifically made you feel. Its kinda like how you&#039;ll have one of those bad days where theres this lingering feeling of bad, but sometimes i can force myself the opposite. I can make myself have a lingering good feeling, its all a matter of how i push my brain into feeling, can anyone else do this??  I feel like theres so many things our brains are capable of doing in the control of our feelings physically and mentally but how can you take it a step further?

It was used to heal depression, anxiety (for example of the terminal ill) and to beat addictions. The original alcoholics anonymous healing plan involved taking LSD in good set and setting! Beside medicinal use, LSD enriched the lives of many people both artistically and spiritually, see the Beatles, Jimmy Hendrix and Aldous Huxley (Brave New World). Others were scientifically inspired: The PCR method in biology (Worth the Nobel Price) was, so says its inventor, explicitly found with the use of LSD!

Basically a couple of my med-fag female friends went away for 4 weeks to a rural hospital to do their rotation there. They were staying with a few other guys and girls who also go to the same hospital as me.  When they came back to visit me over the weekend, they started talking about one of the dudes (I&#039;ll call him Jacob) from our hospital who went over to the rural hospital as well.  They would say things like &#039;Oh, Jacob says the funniest things, he&#039;s so witty, he&#039;s so cute, blah blah blah&#039;.  Then one of them turns to me, her eyes light up and is all like &#039;Anon! Are you jealous?!?&#039; XD. The expression on my face had not changed markedly before this, nor was I questioning them in great detail about him.  I&#039;m just like sitting there thinking &#039;wtf? We&#039;re friends and she&#039;s asking me if I&#039;m jealous&#039;.  She later explained that she meant that I was jealous that he is now their friend as well. But even in that context, asking me if I&#039;m jealous that they have a new male friend makes no sense... right? Considering she has other male friends too.  So about a week later when she comes back again, I decide to tease her and say &#039;So how is your new bf Jacob going?&#039;. She immediately gets excited and blurts out &#039;ANON!! Are you threatened?!?&#039;  Similar thing again happened on facebook. I made a comment like that and she accuses me of being jealous. And her other two friends start laughing and going &#039;N&#039;AWWWW&#039;  Keep in mind that I have a gf that she knows about too.  So what do you think. The fuck does she think about me??

I once started a thread which had only a number and I said to call it. We got some participating and eventually we were consistently on the 1st page and this guy who&#039;s number it was had been completely doxed and people were sending shit to his house.

So now i ask you... would you still not press that button? or would you put these miserable meaningless creatures out of there lives?", "threadId": "702787794"}, {"teaser": "Kik: Stanleybourder  Let&#039;s trade pics of hot girls and compare cock sizes", "threadId": "702787803"}, {"teaser": "How does B feel about banning hashtags like #sissyslut and #sissyass , these were rife with sexting ready traps and trans, was able to pretty much browse and find SOMEONE to play with in DM&#039;s,,,Why is IG is progressive and leftist why would they ban these tags?", "threadId": "702787804"}, {"teaser": "Nostalgia with us on connectcast dot tv slash errlybird To Catch a Predator stream", "threadId": "702787925"}, {"teaser": "We&#039;ll do whatever the lucky anon who rolls 69 tells us to do.
