This guy, apart from being an ultimate amoral pussy as far as his own blog is concerned*, has gone to great lengths to destroy one of the best music festivals in Europe, and certainly the biggest and most freedom-oriented music festival in Poland. Woodstock, the music festival I&#039;m writing about, has been here for last 22 years, giving people from all over the world (approx. 1mln partakers each year) one week in a year, where they could honestly fuck merkel, fuck trump, fuck the arguments about lgbt, fuck sandniggas, fuck everything that concerns a sentient person and just chill. Together with our right-wing politicians, Piotr Wielgucki does his best/worst to kill the festival, just because of his animosities toward the organiser.

This guy, apart from being an ultimate amoral pussy as far as his own blog is concerned*, has gone to great lengths to destroy one of the best music festivals in Europe, and certainly the biggest and most freedom-oriented music festival in Poland. Woodstock, the music festival I&#039;m writing about, has been here for last 22 years, giving people from all over the world (approx. 1mln partakers each year) one week in a year, where they could honestly fuck merkel, fuck trump, fuck the arguments about lgbt, fuck sandniggas, fuck everything that concerns a sentient person and just chill. Together with our right-wing politicians, Piotr Wielgucki does his best/worst to kill the festival, just because of his animosities toward the organiser. I am fairly aware that 4chan isn&#039;t some private army, and I don&#039;t expect you to hack the shit out of him or something. All that would of course be appreciated, but if anything, just find me the address of the fucker. * namely: reaching &quot;fame&quot; by creating contests with prizes and not giving them afterwards to the winners (often banned and insulted); abusing his admin power to change the content of other blogs within his platform; copypasting articles from other platforms into his own, posing as the authors switched to his own. ps.

There are Trump supporters all over the internet, so cancerous that no website can escape it. Actual channels and users dedicating everything they can to Trump.

They&#039;re fat, lazy, jobless pieces of shit who spend all their time at home shoving food into their faces. No friends, no social aspect, no life. THATS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ONLINE LIKE TRUMP OMG ITS SO CLEAR NOW!!! A lot of people on the internet have no life, no education, etc. When something like Trump comes along, they are quick to make everything they do revolve around their idol. Thats why there are so many people following Trump to every state he goes to. They have no Job, no friends, NO LIFE. But don&#039;t worry, there are only so little pathetic, lifeless Americans that exist. Trump is gonna lose, and when he does, everyone who dedicated their nonexistent lives to him will crumble. They&#039;ll die out, become nothing again. Save the date: November 8th, 2016. The day the lifeless Trumpies lose their shit.

Many of those who survived were determined to leave Europe and start new lives in Israel or the United States. The population shifts brought on by the Holocaust and by Jewish emigration were astounding. &gt;According to the American Jewish Yearbook, the Jewish population of Europe was about 9.5 million in 1933. In 1950, the Jewish population of Europe was about 3.5 million. In 1933, 60 percent of all Jews lived in Europe. In 1950, most Jews (51 percent) lived in the Americas (North and South combined), while only a third of the world&#039;s Jewish population lived in Europe. This is from the first result that google links to when you search how many jews died in WW2, it even has that auto-answer box that says SIX MILLION JEWS in big letters. This is from the second result. &gt;The claim that 6 million Jews died during World War II is wrong. &gt;During the war period, before and shortly afterward, 5 million Jews went to Israel, and the Jewish population of North America increased from 4 million to 6 million. &gt;Jews also went to Brazil, Argentina, Australia and other nations. This accounts for the decrease of 6 million Jews in Europe. &gt;The world Jewish population was 15 million circa 1929 but it reached an estimated high of 18 million in 1989, an increase of 16%, which would have been impossible if 6 million Jews died in World War II. just sayin 1st - https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005687 2nd - http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=943", "threadId": "701968212"}, {"teaser": "Cont from yesterday.

Pic U/R My wife refused to have sex with me for 2 years. I begged like a bitch every few days for 2 years and on 4 occasions she gave me some pussy. One night I really wanted some pussy so I begged hard like a bitch. She kept refusing so I rolled over and pouted like a little bitch when I had a wake up call. A voice in my head said you are a fucking man you dumb mother fucker and I told the voice oh yeah I forgot. I jumped up and stood with my legs spread to show dominance and I said listen here bitch I&#039;m a man and you&#039;re a woman do you know what the fuck that means? IT&#039;S MEANS I&#039;M BIGGER AND i CAN FUCK YOU ANYTIME I WANT AND ANY TIME I&#039;M NOT FUCKING YOU ISN&#039;T BECAUSE I CAN&#039;T IT&#039;S BECAUSE I LET YOU HAVE A CHOICE. YOU HAVE DISRESPECTED ME BY NOT DOING YOUR WIFELY DUTIES FOR TWO FUCKING YEARS YOU HAVE NOW LOST THE CHOICE I GAVE YOU. TONIGHT I AM GETTING SOME PUSSY. Of course she talked mad shit and wild threats saying things like &quot;the fuck you are&quot; But I walked firmly around the bed to her side just looking at her as she continued the &quot;you better back the fuck up&quot; Her talk was met with silence. I reached both hands down to grab her legs and she started going ape shit kicking me but it would be useless. After a short struggle I pinned her legs down to the bed and as I did she tightly shut her legs. I struggled to spread her as she started punching me with both hands just wildly swinging with all her strength. I switched missions from spreading her to pinning her arms, they were getting to effective. They were easily penned at the wrist. I used my knees to attempt to spread her, it would be harder than I thought. Her wrist had to be squeezed extremely hard as well as force shoving her arms down. I had to use my chest to control the violent side to side motion of her chest area in an attempt to buck me off. Random thought - isn&#039;t it crazy that a woman sometimes will prefer to buck a man off when all she had to do was simply fuck him off?", "threadId": "701986717"}, {"teaser": "Hey Dross! eat shit!", "threadId": "701986745"}, {"teaser": "I&#039;m a meta human with the ability to generate electricity from my entire body.

All have sinned and therefore cannot enter into Heaven on their own accord Isaiah 53:6, \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; Romans 3:23, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d  Romans 3:10, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d 2. There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3.

John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701997107"}, {"teaser": "Send me your gf&#039;s/wife&#039;s or sister&#039;s kik and i will send them dick.

Microsoft is taking harder stance against hate speech. On Friday it said it wants to make it easier for people to report online abuse in its consumer communities, which includes everything from Skype, OneDrive, and Outlook to gaming community Xbox Live. &quot;For many years we\u2019ve sought to protect our customers by prohibiting hate speech and removing such content from our hosted consumer services. While neither our principles nor our policies are changing, we are refining some of our processes to make it easier for customers to report hate speech,&quot; explains Microsoft&#039;s chief online-safety officer Jacqueline Beauchere in a blog post. To that end, Microsoft introduced a new form that makes it easier to report hate speech and a clear definition of the kinds of things that constitute hate speech. Anything that advocates violence or promotes hatred based on age, disability, gender, national or ethnic origin or race, religions or sexual orientation/gender identity is the kind of thing Microsoft will nix. The new form also makes it easier for people to log a protest if their sites or posts were found to be in violation and blocked or removed. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/getsupport?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wf=0&amp;wfName=capsub&amp;productkey=hatespeech&amp;locale=en-us&amp;ccsid=636080036246240401 Now whut, Legunz???", "threadId": "702004418"}, {"teaser": "What you gonna do?", "threadId": "702004444"}, {"teaser": "How can I find a slut at school /b/?", "threadId": "702004499"}, {"teaser": "&gt;Dubs gets pussy+face &gt;Trips gets full set+vids (only hj vids)", "threadId": "702004504"}, {"teaser": "Post girls you know you want anon to fap to cont. from &gt;&gt;701992925", "threadId": "702004603"}, {"teaser": "Dubs decides what I say", "threadId": "702004630"}, {"teaser": "anon, what when is a GOOD time to RAPE a WOMAN ?", "threadId": "702004655"}, {"teaser": "Are you jealous, light-skinned man?", "threadId": "702004679"}, {"teaser": "9/11 meme thread", "threadId": "702004772"}, {"teaser": "should I order a pizza faggots?", "threadId": "702004784"}, {"teaser": "you know what to do", "threadId": "702004823"}, {"teaser": "Nogle som har et link til Oure efterskole mappen?", "threadId": "702004842"}, {"teaser": "Why are women indecisive autismals?

I&#039;m 18 now, my fuckups can&#039;t be excused by saying &quot;Oh, sorry I&#039;m still a kid.&quot; You&#039;ll probably call me out saying I&#039;m just an edgy 18 year old and that I don&#039;t know the hardships of life yet and that I still have a lot of growing up to do. I don&#039;t see myself growing up, some people are honestly just mistakes.  Okay. Thank you for listening. Please tell me, is there something waiting on the other side? I&#039;m honestly paranoid. After I kill myself is it all just poof and I won&#039;t feel anything anymore? Or is the afterlife an infinite void where you just think about things you&#039;ve done for all eternity?

Make your name be some generic name, but with muffin added before it. So for instance, &quot;Muffin Max&quot; Next what you should do is post pic related, or a similar style of picture on your page, with a caption that makes you think that there will be some sort of happening that is about to occur, for instance, &quot;4 days, 8 hours, you can not stop the muffin men.&quot; Next, make sure to comment on your friend&#039;s pages, &quot;You can not stop the muffin men.&quot; With enough attention, all of these other self entitled websites such as Tumblr and Reddit will start to gain interest, and investigate the matter.

The website as a whole has been going down the shitter for a LONG time. It isnt news, we all know this. But, as of recently, there have been even more cancerous ToS that require YouTube channels to adhere to ridiculous rules (if you want to know what they are, just go to the YouTube front page where all the cancerous drama channels are covering it, or google it).  So my question is, if the YouTube ship is finally sinking, which I hope is the case.. Where to now? I know Vimeo is a wasteland but I don&#039;t know of any video outlets that are comparable to YouTube. If possible, someone on 8ch&#039;s /baph/ boards could probably make a brand new video outlet with as little rules as possible, like we have on here.

The world-class Memesters - I mean the big guys, like Johnny Hammersticks and Billy Kuahana - they&#039;re out there day and night, burning the midnight meme-oil, working tirelessly to craft that next big meme. And you know what, kid? 99 times out of a hundred, that new meme fails. Someone dismisses it as bait, or says it&#039;s &quot;tryhard,&quot; or ignores it as they copy/paste the latest crappost copypasta dreamt up by those sorry excuses for cut-rate memers over at reddit. The Meme Game is rough, kid, and I don&#039;t just mean the one you just lost :). It&#039;s a rough business, and for every artisan meme you craft in your meme bakery, some sucker at 9gag has a picture of a duck or some crap that a million different Johnny No-Names will attach a milion different captions to. Chin up, kid. Don&#039;t get all mopey on me. You&#039;ve got skill. You&#039;ve got talent. You just need to show your drive.

It was at the Ballard branch. I was informed that I couldn&#039;t pay it in because Wells Fargo has already closed my account - without my authorization. I was stunned and asked how that had happened, and they said that all my money was taken by their fees and there was no activity for two months so they closed the account. (In other words, they took everything and had no more use for me.) I didn&#039;t know about any fees, I&#039;d never had fees before and the bank hadn&#039;t informed me they were applying fees to my account, so all that money was taken without my consent. I asked them to fix it and return my money to me as this was all a mistake and I&#039;d not been informed. The staff stalled and wasted time. They said they couldn&#039;t do it. They said it was complicated. They said I wasn&#039;t being respectful even though I wasn&#039;t yelling. I pointed that it wasn&#039;t respectful to steal money and close people&#039;s accounts without their permission. That was when the branch manager, David Nyugen, came over and told me: &quot;Get out&quot;. He snapped his fingers in my face to make me move, repeating &quot;get out&quot;. He refused for 3 full minutes to give me his card so I could complain to customer service. His staff member, also refused to give me the manager&#039;s card but pretended to look for it really slowly. He called the cops because I was &quot;causing a scene&quot;. even though he was the one yelling at me and snapping his fingers in my face to make me jump. While on the phone, he was giving my personal bank details to the cops and describing how I looked. I kept saying: &quot;But you&#039;ve taken my money. Where is my money? Give me my money.&quot; I asked him why he was giving my personal bank details to the cops, as that was another blatant unlawful action. Cops kill women of color like me. Not only did Wells Fargo steal my money, they threatened my life by calling the cops.

The only reported deaths were from mixing it with other drugs.  Recently the DEA has decided to make Kratom a schedule 1 illegal drug. This means it had no accepted medical use and will be illegal to possess and distribute. Current kratom users will have to resort to other drugs, likely causing an increase in heroin usage as well as an increase in deaths and addiction. If you have a few moments, sign this petition.
