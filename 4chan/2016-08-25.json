For years our school has had the same clothing policy: two fingers of clothes on shoulder, no tits, no bellybutton, shorts are lower than fingers. This was never properly enforced and many rules (mostly the two finger one) were often broken. These rules obviously target women, but they apply to men too (we just don&#039;t have any faggots that can&#039;t dress themselves.) Two days ago, a new rule has been introduced: no ripped jeans. It has been very strictly enforced so far. Our next weekly meeting with the school board and heads on Friday will decide the fate of the new rule. Other than me, the entire council is against it. We are a &quot;progressive&quot; school, we even have a faggot flag hanging in one of the halls. The main femenist teacher in our school Ms. X, runs the GSA. She has somehow managed to get invited to next weeks meeting, and from what I&#039;ve heard, she is planning to bring &quot; tons of articles and information against the policy as well as a documentary&quot;. The main arguments the other council members are presenting with her are: &quot;equality and also that the dress code simply does not fit what [NAME OF SCHOOL] stands for: individualism and being progressive.&quot; I personally don&#039;t care if the rule stays or not, but I really want to stick it to Ms. X. She is my English teacher and constantly shuts me down for analyzing &quot;too logically&quot;. What arguments and sources do I bring to the table to help keep the rule in place?", "threadId": "700966076"}, {"teaser": "I got banned from momless some weeks ago.

Day 1, Morning: The blacks wake up, but sense that something is wrong. There is no radio and no T.V. Electrical power is partially gone. Venturing out into the world Realizing this, they immediately begin to loot.It\u2019s a free for all. Windows are broken, cars are stolen from garages &amp; parking lots. By the afternoon, most valuables in stores &amp; private homes have been stolen. By the end of the First Week: Electrical power is all but gone. Working blacks are beginning to understand the nightmare. But no one listens to them; they are &quot;Uncle Tom&#039;s&quot;. There is no government, no order. There is nothing to stop them. By the end of the First Month: Looting &amp; anarchy continue. War begins among black gangs as they battle for territory &amp; vanishing resources. There is no longer any electricity, and most fresh food has spoiled. Fires are widespread from looting, and very few know how to put them out. There is no more tap water. By The End Of The Third Month: Canned food can still be found but fresh water, milk, bread &amp; produce are non-existent. Gasoline becomes scarce. Garbage &amp; sanitation services are gone, &amp; diseases begin to rise. Some hospitals are still running but with almost no trained staff.  By The End Of The First Year: Starvation is rampant. Food becomes the most valuable thing in the &quot;New Black America.&quot; Trees are cut down for firewood. Many die from cold. Most infants do not survive, as medical care becomes non-existent. A few blacks hoard all the food for themselves by the use of force (just like Africa today.). Blacks begin to reorganize by tribes. Gangs rule the city. Travel is almost impossible, except on horseback, &amp; gangs frequently murder travelers. Nomads now roam from destroyed town-to-town looking for food.  By The End Of Five Years: Nearly 2/3rds of the blacks are dead. The life span is down to about 35 years, as it is in many black countries in Africa today.

For some reason I answered &quot;no&quot; because I thought that maybe he&#039;d give me another quiz. Turns out I got that very same quiz, answered wrong on the very first one and had a choice to burn for eternity in hell or wander the earth floating around as a ghost. I chose being a ghost because in my mind it was less of a severe punishment. The person said something to the effect of &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot;. I was floating around trying to get people&#039;s attention in the dead of night but nothing worked. It was hell, basically. It was monotonous, I could do nothing but float around the skies for eternity.  Is monotony true hell? I woke up thinking that maybe the life I&#039;m living now is hell. I do nothing basically 24/7. I work from home but besides that I just sit around playing video games and occasionally go to the gym or the doctor.

Then Anonymous happened and the feds forced m00t to nerf 4chan or get all his servers seized. Having zero spine, m00t kicked off all the subversives and a bunch of teenaged middle-schoolers took their place. They were too stupid to recognize irony, so the racism around here became real. Then a bunch of neo-Nazi white supremacists from Stormfront realized they had a potential audience of impressionable, low-IQ teenyboppers and they invaded 4chan in earnest.

People stress me out and annoy me, and I don&#039;t like being around them at all. I wish I could live in islotaion, where I would have no one but myself to worry about. I enjoy being by myself, I find it relaxing and comforting. I never really gained anything from social contact besides frustration, embarassment, and annoying other people.  I&#039;m saying all this because, unfortunately, in this world it is very hard to be alone. At one point you could probably just run off and leave other people, because societies were small as shit. But now, you&#039;re born right in the middle of a massive structure that the only way out, is to work in it, but once you&#039;re working in it you can&#039;t leave. The closest outlet is miles away, and by the time you got there on foot you&#039;d starve if you hadn&#039;t bought food, but to buy food you need a job, and to get a job you need to look somewhat decent, and to do that you need a building to live in and a car, and then you need to spend months paying off your rent. As you can see, it snowballs to the point where leaving is impossible.  All I really want is to go find some decent place in the middle of absolutely fucking nowhere, but not a nigger country like South America or Africa or some shit. I just want to build a shitty cabin and fish and hunt and live out the rest of my days in total solitude, but the fucking fact is, the government owns everything.

In his hand he held a Bible. When they reached the chimp exhibit, the atheist said to his son &quot;Look at the chimpanzees. See how similar they are to us? That&#039;s because we have a common ancestor, son. Evolution is true and God is not.&quot; The atheist tore a page out of the Bible and threw it into the chimp exhibit. A chimp quickly swung over to the Bible page and ate it. &quot;See how the chimp ate that Bible page? If God really existed, he wouldn&#039;t have allowed the chimp to eat it.&quot; The atheist and his son continued to visit ever animal exhibit, and the atheist father did the same thing at each and every one. Finally, only one page of the Bible remained and only one animal remained to be visited. They came up to the aquarium where a big octopus was laying on a rock. The atheist ripped out the last Bible page and dropped it into the aquarium. Suddenly, the octopus grabbed the Bible page and began to come up, out of the water! The atheist and boy were so surprised their mouths fell agape! The octopus looked the father in the eye, and with an inhuman voice began to read from the page! &quot; Psalm 14:1! The fool hath said in his heart,&quot; There is no God!&quot; The atheist stood there, speechless! The octopus began to speak again &quot;Do you think that because we animals ate pages of the Bible, it means that God is not real? Look how much of a fool you are! Do you not know that the Word of God is nourishment to all who partake of it! You fool!&quot;. The atheist dropped to his knees and began to cry. The octopus spoke again &quot;Accept Christ, and your sins will be absolved, sinner&quot;. With a tear-stained face, the atheist said in a shaking voice: &quot;I do! I accept Christ and God and the Holy Spirit! I was such a fool for not believing!&quot;. The former-atheist did the sign of the cross and stood up.

Admit it, maybe it wasn&#039;t the case some 200 years ago, but nowadays being white sucks whereas being black is cool as hell. 9) We got a sense of what family is about. 10) We get MANY children so that our genes will last long on this motherfucking earth, not like your average pathetic two children. 11) If you don&#039;t die a virgin, and happen to get a daughter...chances are she&#039;ll be sucking and swallowing black dicks :) I could be going on and on and on but you get the point by now.

There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3.

Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701001999"}, {"teaser": "Leg thread.

All have sinned and therefore cannot enter into Heaven on their own accord Isaiah 53:6, \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; Romans 3:23, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d  Romans 3:10, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d 2. There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3. Jesus lived a sinless life and shed his blood on the cross so we could be forgiven. John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701009879"}, {"teaser": "found my gf&#039;s profile on backpages from a few months back before i started dating her.

I have a weird situation and I don&#039;t know what to do.  I&#039;m currently living with my gf since February.  And she expects me to make a move for marriage.  But I&#039;m really unsecure about that just because she&#039;s mentally unstable.  And I don&#039;t even know if I love her. I were never in love before so I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s the real love. She&#039;s my first long term relationship and I like being with her. But I guess that&#039;s not enough to marry someone.  When we had a talk some weeks ago and we discussed about what Would happen if I would left her she just said : &quot;My last ex ( 4 months relationship) hurt me with so bad with leaving me I started cutting myself. I don&#039;t know what would happen if you would leave me. &quot; I guess that was the hint that she wouldn&#039;t only cut her arms or legs.  So the problem is that I am not sure if the love is strong enough for me to keep smiling everyday and keep up with the shit I&#039;m going through.  Or if it isn&#039;t worth it and would risk that she might kill herself.  I mean I never had big feels for anyone or events that happened like the dead of a close friend of mine. It was just like : Okay he&#039;s not here anymore.

First off I&#039;m FAT AS FUCK. Like over 300 pounds fat. &gt;inb4 &quot;go gym lose weight&quot; I have tried that but my anxiety gets in the way... you&#039;ll see why this is a problem soon. I absolutely hate my body and it depresses me to no end that I am like this. I have been trying to lose weight since I was 8, even being sent to a fat camp for a month when I was 9. I have severe depression and social anxiety which actually might be Avoidant Personality Disorder according to my doctor. I CANNOT be around people in any shape or form and guess what? I HAVE TO START A NEW FUCKING COLLEGE IN 2 WEEKS. If I don,t I will be kicked out of my house by my mother with whom I live. The anxiety it gives me thinking about it makes me want to kms. I don&#039;t leave the house for months on end (why I don&#039;t go to the gym). I have no friends (not in the cute loner way, more like I literally don&#039;t have any fucking friends) and my relationships with my family have broken down (apart from the one with my mum). My family even accused me of using my sexual assault as an excuse to not go to college and said it was my fault. Oh, and they said they expected it to happen to my much slimmer and prettier sister. I do not speak to anyone that I know and have done for years. I&#039;m also broke (another reason why I can&#039;t sign up for a gym) and homeless (living in emergency accommodation atm). Any job that involves people (which is like all of them) is a no go. This fucking problem I have gets in the way of everything. I have deep emotional trauma from when I was bullied both physically and mentally in secondary school and I believe this is why I have such a problem with people now.

Something in the pumpkin spice mixture is actively interfering with their metabolism, causing lethargy and increased conversion of blood sugar into fat.&quot; Dr. Beck and her team are currently investigating the use of pumpkin spice in the treatment of dangerously underweight individuals.

A few months ago my friend died. Too keep things anonymous we are going to call my friend Jeff. Jeff&#039;s death was unexpected to say the least, he was only 17. We don&#039;t live in the safest part of town and he was shot like an animal, he didn&#039;t deserve that,he deserved more out of life. Nobody knows who the shooter. We don&#039;t know if the shooter had a personal thing with Jeff (which is unlikely considering Jeff has never hurt anybody previously). Jeff and I have been friends for a bit until his death and when my mom told me at the dinner table I was shocked. It hurts because of how much that moment sticks with me and how much detail I remember when I finally realized my only friend died that day. Jeff and I were never really that popular, he was an orphan who was not with his parents for long until he moved until his foster home. He didn&#039;t like speaking to others and neither did I. We were often made fun of by the other kids, mostly on our looks and Jeff&#039;s way of speaking (he was not the best at speaking therefor avoided conversation). I had Jeff and Jeff had me. Jeff was everything for me, he was a role model and a friend. After Jeff&#039;s death people that probably didn&#039;t even know he existed before his death were flocking to social media about how much they cared about Jeff. People who have bullied us are praising Jeff and saying he will be missed. After a while people jumped on the hype train and now everyone is pretending like they cared when they didnt know he existed the day before his death. Dont get me wrong its great seeing the support Jeff is getting but i HATE how people are using this as an excuse to get attention and to show that they cared when really, they don&#039;t. I&#039;ve missed every moment without Jeff. Now everyone is saying bs like &quot;Dicks out for Jeff&quot; and &quot;Jeff died for our prayers&quot;.

This means roughly 60% of manmade CO2 is not absorbed and thus increases atmospheric CO2. We may therefore say we need to reduce global CO2 production by around 60% to reach a break even point - but this ignores the fact that absorption rises along with our production. Still, something around this number can be found in the scientific research. &quot;In order to stabilize CO2 concentrations at about 450 ppm by 2050, global emissions would have to decline by about 60%. Industrialized countries greenhouse gas emissions would have to decline by about 80%.&quot; -Barack Obama&#039;s Presidential Climate Action Plan 80% - And all our proposed plans (if fully executed) would reduce emissions by less than 5%. The United States accounts for about 17% of manmade CO2. Japan, 4%. Korea, 2%. European nations between 1 and 2 percent each. China and the developing world account for over 47% of manmade CO2. So if you wiped out all of the US, all of Europe, Japan, and Korea, and then managed to reduce China by around 25%, you would be near the break even point for CO2 absorption. Perhaps you start to see now what we are actually facing here. A 60% global reduction in CO2 cannot be accomplished without creating a worldwide economic depression which would no doubt kill millions of human beings.

Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701040776"}, {"teaser": "1 (336) 328 7798", "threadId": "701040777"}, {"teaser": "We made it on wiki.", "threadId": "701040807"}, {"teaser": "Let&#039;s face it - Kony2012 was an absolute disaster.

First off politics because you guys are crazy about it. Trump loses, he&#039;s a plant, just like Bernie Sanders. Bernie gets paid out (has he already? hmm august &#039;16, can&#039;t remember) he retires, well off. Trump gets gov support for his businesses.  The Clinton&#039;s are historically known for taking care of there placers. Trump wrote a book 10 years after election, said he never really wanted to be president, but wanted to try to make a &quot;difference&quot;. About 20 years after that, 2 of his kids come out and tell everyone the truth, how he was a plant set up by Bill and Hill. His second daughter, forgot her name, received gene therapy and went full asian. Just remember she was very cute. World gasps, but people kind of knew already. They were seen a lot together after the run. People more worried about Neo-Capitalism (Social Corporatism) and a living income taking place of jobs (a lot of people in depression and 5-hydroxytryptamine drugs). It&#039;s stable, but job workers (those that can actually get one), are much better off.. Can travel, live longer, heathier, gene therapy, buy nice things, etc. Over population is a problem, AI working overtime terraforming Moon, Mars, and Venus. Droids build big structures in months that would take 20 years to build in 2016. Automation revolution is over, we lost. Water in 3rd world countries contaminated with potent chemical castrators. Media doesn&#039;t talk about it. Neurospring is a BioComputer devd up by an AI created by Alphabook in 2050s.

I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram. I couldn&#039;t associate with Jews or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty this was naturally a living nightmare. After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Christian friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i&#039;ve never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Christians and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn&#039;t get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven&#039;t been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad.
