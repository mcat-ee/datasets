Alright /b/, I fucked up last night. I just moved in a French flat I&#039;m renting for one week, and I struggled opening the old door consisting of two locks and some other fancy handles. I was too stupid to realize that both keys are actually needed to open the door. So when I left with one key for sake of simplicity, leaving one lock unlocked and came back, I realized that I messed up. The landlord who organized everything remotly called a service. It took the guy like 5 seconds to open the fucking door, as is an old simple key (pic related). He then charged me 230\u20ac, including extra fees because it was one hour before midnight. He ripped me off, right? The landlord said that the agency she called couldn&#039;t tell the price beforehand as the usual company they order are in vacation. But I heard of one case where a poor guy from France was charged more than 1000\u20ac in a similar case.  Anyway, I hate myself for relying on such assholes. I wished I came up with an own solution such as organizing a ladder and then enter the open window (3rd floor) or unlocking the door using basic tools or whatsoever. I should at least have had the courage to negotiate with the guy or make him feel uncomfortable. But I was too much of a foreign pussy to do so. Feels bad. Need to become more street smart.

He has since claimed that he found the pictures on a website named 4chan&#039;s Random Picturing Board. He hasn&#039;t admitted to me what he is doing on this website, only stating that he enjoys &quot;the lull&#039;s&quot;. This website is on my son&#039;s AOL history and after visiting it myself I am extremely concerned.

However, more concerning was the repetition of gay themes, and a cult-like worshiping of a certain Bill Kualitz. Also the frequent mention of a pool being closed due to AIDS, as I have heard my son say once before I knew he was what he calls a &quot;betard&quot;, is this some sort of code word? So I think I&#039;m right in saying most of this Random Board users are members of the Gay, Trans. and Bi community? Does the lull&#039;s refer to anal sex?

It was a long discussion, and at 12 I thoroughly disagreed with her. Now I&#039;m older(mid 20&#039;s) and I&#039;m certainly not attracted to men, but I&#039;m starting to understand what she meant.

And by the way she has 77.3m followers on Instagram right now so imagine her reach during a presidential campaign... Kanye has almost 24.4m followers on Twitter. Kanye&#039;s Twitter game was always a huge entertaining which is the same as Donald Trump right now. Wake the fuck up America. You are all being entertained right now. I truly hope a GREAT candidate like Bernie will run against Kanye and hopefully the internet won&#039;t fall for all the Kanye&#039;s bullshit. This is going to be a HUGE WAR. They both can reach almost 100million people on their favorite social media. He will have all the black vote (no surprise here). Probably a ton of millennials too since Bernie won&#039;t be running and they will be looking for the same kind of message: free college, environment, prisons (he will promote the war on racism like a madman believe me). Marijuana legalization will probably be a big thing also that will help him get a lot of vote. I mean, just look at some of Kanye&#039;s lyrics just for the fun: -No one man should have all that power (who&#039;s the most powerful person on the planet right now?) -The clock\u2019s tickin\u2019, I just count the hours (you know he&#039;s cooking his plan) He will apologize to Taylor Swift in public once for all, and BAM! He will get tons of Swift&#039;s fans vote. When there are scandal between him and Taylor, it&#039;s great for both of them because they get a lot of followers in return.

My problem is that even though that spark is kinda gone for me, and almost completely for her, we dated for 5 months (8 months if you include the summer where I got to see her 2-3 times) and I think I still love her. I still care for her extremely, and I know she cares for me too, but for her it&#039;s &quot;different&quot; and she doesn&#039;t see a relationship with romantically anymore. It&#039;s tearing her apart because I can tell she wants to feel something for me but doesn&#039;t, and it rips me apart because I still feel something for her but can&#039;t be with her.  My question is how do I make that energy come back for us, for her especially? Do we backtrack and figure out what brought us together? Do I try sex? Or should I just count my losses and move on?

All have sinned and therefore cannot enter into Heaven on their own accord Isaiah 53:6, \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; Romans 3:23, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d  Romans 3:10, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d 2. There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3. Jesus lived a sinless life and shed his blood on the cross so we could be forgiven. John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701149191"}, {"teaser": "Feminist hate thread Expand my collection /b/ros", "threadId": "701149347"}, {"teaser": "Mental Illness Thread: What mental illness do you have /b/?

It brought images and stories from Africa so unfathomably horrific to millions of Americans nationwide and little to nothing was done to remedy the situation. Right now, Joseph Kony is still on the loose hurting countless men women and children and enslaving and murdering as he pleases. This has to stop. It&#039;s been 4 years since Jason Russell and his team failed to do a single thing besides raise awareness about the atrocities perpetrated by the LRA and Joseph Kony. It is time to eradicate this monster and make sure there is a brighter future for everyone affected by this tragedy. Donald Trump is teaming up with Google and Elon Musk to acquire the technology to successfully hunt down Kony and are hiring the best private military contractors on the face of the earth. We will not stop until our objectives have been completed. When we as Americans want to see a change in the world, we go out there and make it happen.

All have sinned and therefore cannot enter into Heaven on their own accord Isaiah 53:6, \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; Romans 3:23, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d  Romans 3:10, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d 2. There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3.

John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701158285"}, {"teaser": "First three words that come to mind", "threadId": "701158313"}, {"teaser": "I POSTED IT AGAIN xD", "threadId": "701158357"}, {"teaser": "Ask a professional tard wrangler anything", "threadId": "701158466"}, {"teaser": "What happened to Leslie Jones&#039;s website?

I&#039;ve been browsing 4chan since 2007 or so. I&#039;m not on /b/ anymore and I&#039;m most of the time around /wg/, but that really doesn&#039;t matter. Things&#039;ve been pretty rough for me lately. I&#039;m a Psychologist and I work as a behavior therapist and overall my money incomes are great. But I still live with my parents and they are currently bankrupt. So yeah, most of my money goes to help with outgoings. There&#039;s been days where I strived for motivation, even to get out of bed, take a shower and go to work. And I nailed it, even though it was hard. Whenever I feel sad, which I&#039;ve been a lot lately, I browse 4chan which works like a safe haven to me; not that I try to &quot;forget&quot; about my problems but to kinda have the feel to hold on into something. I know, it might sound confusing, but yeah, that&#039;s it. BUT, the other part of my money I like to spend with my activities and, among &#039;em, I love going to raves and electronic music concerts. It makes me feel alive and gives me purpose, put me on track for the days. And Armin Van Buuren, is going to perform at my country. You might wonder how happy I got since I actually LOVE him so much. There&#039;s a contest with the chance of meeting him in person. I literally cried about thinking of the possibility so I joined without thinking. But this contest involves people to log into facebook and vote for me (yeah, lame) and I&#039;m not your average high school/fraternity popular dude.

Thing is, I don&#039;t know if she really meant it or not, but she told me she isn&#039;t into me like I am with her. I don&#039;t know if she really means that, or if she only said that to not give me any hope since she may not break up with her boyfriend.  Still though, she loves spending a lot of alone time with me.

Here&#039;s the TL;DR If you write equations like this, you&#039;re an asshole.  Here&#039;s why these equations are shit. They&#039;re ambiguous. And I don&#039;t mean they&#039;re ambiguous because of the precedence of multiplication or division. Multiplication and division have the same precedence and should normally be performed going left to right. This shit is ambiguous because of the parentheses. Here&#039;s why: Some math books (my calculus and physics books included) have the notion that implicit multiplication has a higher precedence than explicit multiplication or division. That is, if two terms are juxtaposed then that multiplication is done implicitly and happens before other multiplication or division. An example of this would be something like 2x or 2(3). While 2x and 2*x give you the same answer (same thing for 2(3) and 2*3), they aren&#039;t exactly an equal expression in certain contexts. Someone like me that agrees with the notion of implicit multiplication being done first will argue that 48\u00f72(9+3) \u2260 48\u00f72*(9+3) I would never argue that 48\u00f72*(9+3) is anything other than 288 (48\u00f72*(9+3) = 24*12 = 288), but due to the notion of performing implicit multiplication before division or multiplication, I would state that 48\u00f72(9+3) = 48\u00f72(12) 48\u00f724 = 2. On the other side, not all books use this notion that implicit multiplication should happen before explicit multiplication. People that were taught this way will(should) perform multiplication and division left to right at the same precedence. These people will argue that 48\u00f72(9+3) = 48\u00f72*(9+3) And there lies the ambiguity. In the case of 48\u00f72(9+3), both 2 and 288 are correct answers. Why are the both correct? Because after having done research on this subject, I can&#039;t find a clear consensus one way or the other.

Now before I get into this next part let me tell you that this girls parents are extremely strict and want me to have nothing to do with her and made her block me and whatnot. So despite all of this we decide to continue dating. about 2 months after I found out she cheated on me, her parents made her block me and we didnt talk for a good week or two, we had a huge shitstorm of me burning her gifts and screaming at her, ect, ect. come to find out that she still wanted to try and be with me. I did aswell. We didnt get together until like a month after the whole shitstorm and before she got back together with me she dropped on me that she hooked up with some guy at her college inbetween this whole period of shit. Me being the naive shit that i am took her back so fast. Let me add in that she&#039;s constantly left me and hurt me inbetween because she was &quot;uncertain that we should be together or that she&#039;s scared.&quot; So fast forward to ANOTHER month later and I got a job at a factory to work 40 hours a week 11AM to 7PM Sunday - Thursday, I worked for about 2 months before i was able to book a fight and a hotel now here I am in Florida. Last night I hugged her from behind and kissed her. Kissing her felt surreal. I felt like for once I had a slice of heaven and so much more. Holding her and playing with her hair felt indescribable.

Basically my thoughts are, I was doing an astronomy lab at my university with a long range thermal imaging camera (very expensive). I myself looked out over the ocean and saw images of an island 3.6 km away. Cool beans I thought. Started researching the camera specs for my lab report (500mm focal length lens etc) I began reading a lot about border control using thermal imaging between watchtowers spaced at 4km intervals, or the Navy using it to detect boats even farther away than that (100s of miles) I got to thinking about the horizon and how a ship disappears because of the curvature of the earth. Now, if the earth was a sphere the island I saw 3km away should be roughly 15ft below eye level (line of sight). Thermal imaging works on line of sight only, it doesn&#039;t bend, or curve. So then how are we capable of seeing so far on a round planet? What am I missing here or screwing up? Again, I&#039;m not trying to say the earth is flat I&#039;m just genuinely trying to understand what I&#039;m missing here.
