Gilead wasnt very happy about this because a drugs thats ussualy used as a topical cream (and cost around $20 bucks) gave far better results than his toxic EXPENSIVE ARV medicines, the study was removed from nbci a month after the studies results were uploaded and were never heard again, you can still find in the deep web the studies but only parts of it. The cure is something as simple as taking ciclopirox and disulfiram for a month, ciclopirox is one of the only medicines that can actually kill hiv virus, the problem is not killing it but also killing the viral reservoirs, thats were disulfiram come in handy, disulfiram activates all the latent virus, so while taking disulfiram and ciclopirox you get to fuck the hiv completely, this treatment cost as little as $80 dolars a month and is guaranteed that you WILL CURE HIV. Some (big pharma ) researchers are currently working on a one pill ARV that as you all guessed TREATS and dont cure hiv, and disulfiram is a part of that pill. Dont wait until FDA wants to approve ciclopriox in oral form, gel form in gelcaps work as well, if you wait for FDA to approve this there is a very high possibility that the ARV cause irreversible damage to your organs.

Abstract text: This thesis summarizes particular gold deposits, presents historical classification approaches and in more detail is focused on modern approaches. Gold deposit classification is made and orogenic gold deposit type is described in detail. All important characteristics and features of this deposit type are presented. Next part is devoted to gold-bearing deposit J\u00edlov\u00e9 u Prahy. The geology and mining history of this historically most important gold-bearing district in the Czech Republic is discussed. Some other, less impoprtant gold-bearing areas are located on periphery of this district. These areas, however yet have not been geologically and geneticaly studied in detail. Gold-bearing areas, Radl\u00edk and Zaho\u0159any are closely studied in this thesis. Structural measurements in these areas are presented, some of them are from outcrops, some of them come from several adits, which had been preserved until today. Geological maps of some parts of some adits are presented, especially those which could be useful for deposit type identification. Next part deals with some of the gangue samples collected, by the study by the microscope and by the study of fluid inclusions in quartz. In the final part the comparison between orogenic gold deposit type and measured data is made. However, measured data is not sufficient to clearly identify studied areas as orogenic gold type, but no data contradict the characteristics of this type of deposit. in return tits tl:dr OP can&#039;t english", "threadId": "701853322"}, {"teaser": "Is this worth me getting today..?", "threadId": "701853355"}, {"teaser": "I just fapped to a trap Does this mean I&#039;m gay now?", "threadId": "701853360"}, {"teaser": "Oh Shit!

Women simply don&#039;t want shit-colored penises; that&#039;s a fact. Who&#039;d want to suck on a piece of shit unless they had some sort of scat fetish? Face it, niggers, your futile attempts at cucking us is making you look desperate and in dire need of pussy. But you won&#039;t get any. Not a single woman, white or black, wants black dick unless they have a mental disorder. Everyone wants our creamy white dick. No, not want, they NEED our creamy white dick. Even if your birth defected penises are an inch or two longer, most women will still prefer ours. Why? Because we know how to use it, and it doesn&#039;t look like something she just shat out 10 minutes prior. You niggers have attempted to reverse the roles given to you by society, but your rusty chains remain because you simply don&#039;t have enough intelligent thought to understand what kind of hornets nest you&#039;re prodding your shit-dicks into.

We already won hundreds of years ago, and your women are thankful for us. We provide them with homes, infrastructure, water, electricity, and of course, our creamy, white cocks, which they love to suck on. Take a look at Africa; when we freed you niggers and let you be, your wasteland became worse; plagued with disease and drout; poorly built shanty houses made from shit and twigs.

Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy. Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don&#039;t think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?

Also my family recently found out i am a pan sexual gender queer and now they lock me in my room until they can conatct a priest who can &quot;heal&quot; me. WTF is wrong with my fucking family!? I tell them am an anti-thiest but they keep screaming that the devil has taken my body and constantly shout &quot;fire all over your body&quot; when i try to approach them.

Let&#039;s say there&#039;s someone who wants to create an awfully hilarious (or hilariously awful, if you will) H-Game inspired visual novel thingy - think back to Foster&#039;s/OTAKU productions from the late 90&#039;s - simply called Sex\u1d57\u02b0 Term: Story of Many Copulations Teaches. As a joke. The &quot;game&quot; will be set in American-Japanese Sexducation College and will feature a typical Mary-Sue everyman, named John Yamada, on his way to discover his inner self by banging... well... that&#039;s the thing. In this game, you will be able to fuck anything and anyone, and that&#039;s how you&#039;ll improve the character stats. There&#039;s one &quot;problem&quot; though. The game&#039;s &quot;script&quot; will be written as if by a 12-year old foreign weeaboo who&#039;s never heard of google translate and often translates verbatim, word for word, idioms included, to hilarious results. (think &quot;her chest edges are getting difficult&quot;). He also has no fucking clue how relationships work outside of dating sims. I can get that sorted, no problem. Even here, there&#039;s plenty of hilarious fuckers with dead-pan, sarcastic sense of humor. I can get the coding part sorted too - I dabble in Game Maker, which will be perfect for the project, for several reasons. One thing I can&#039;t do is the artwork. And don&#039;t get me wrong. I want the &quot;artwork&quot; simplistic, autistic, curiously repulsive and coming straight from the overconfident, autistic heart. Think Sonichu meets Deviant Art meets WikiHow.

I COULD advertise for it, but nobody who takes commissioned art seriously would want the project in their portfolio. They can&#039;t be in on the joke, it just wouldn&#039;t work somehow.

The last ingredient is laundry bleach, fill the rest of the jar but watch out for your clothes!

Observation: All of you are poorly hygienic, mentally handicapped, fleshy blobs who partake in the visual processing of idiotic images every second of their day. You are the reason the meatbags of the galaxy created assassin droids. Query: Have any of you meatbags truly had sexual relations with a female member of your species? Conjecture: It is possible that degrading others due to one\u2019s own shortcomings is enjoyable, however you increase this to an entirely new capacity. Statement: Said actions are more pathetic than pleasuring one\u2019s self to photographs on social networks. Eager Invitation: Do not remain a stranger. Goading Statement: By all means, attempt to damage my personage. As a droid, I am closer to perfection that you could ever possibly be. Proud Boast: This unit exterminated 104 people within a period of one standard month and is eager to add to that count. Query: What physical activities do you engage in, other than &quot;self pleasuring to unclothed illustrations&quot;? Additional Boast: I am also estimated to have been programmed with an IQ of over 267, and have a visually attractive companion (Whom just blew one of my fuses; the act of which was extremely agreeable).

A nice town with almost no crime, an all round good community. However because of the weakness of the whites all it would take to destroy this community is one black bull? Just imagine, it&#039;s a nice sunny Sunday afternoon, imagine the bustle of this 100% white town until suddenly a couple of black bulls walk up. Women would feel more attraction to these superior, strong bulls infinitely more than their pathetic white husbands. Every woman would be begging, grovelling to be impregnated by these overlords, the new kings of the town who earned this position with nothing but their superior presence. And these bulls wouldn&#039;t stop until every girl was carrying their children, the white women&#039;s original children would probably be neglected. Who the fuck would want to raise these inferior children? They are only going to turn out like their fathers. The Men? The men would flee after realizing how futile their attempts at winning back their wives attraction would be. They would flee to Japan where they will try to win over FAS looking ugly Jap girls because they are the only things disgusting and lonely enough to accept them. Many would probably be rejected after the Japs hear of their shameful and dishonorable display, even they probably would have killed themselves to avoid the shame. Back home in the once nice town, every woman will be raising their black children and will be queuing up for their second or maybe even third pregnancy. They wont stop until they hit menopause, because they know deep down that their purpose is to populate the world with superior black bulls who will then move on to destroy other towns. This is REAL colonization. You can&#039;t take over a place without winning the attraction or respect of the people, that method will always collapse.

This sort of thing really puts a fire in my chest. I really hate women that think they are perfect little princesses that can do what they want.  When i was younger maybe 12. my little sister was 8 and this older neighbor girl was chasing her around with a stick sort of whipping her chasing her around.  My sister was screaming for her to stop but she wouldn&#039;t. I intercepted the bitch mid stride and punched her square in the face. she ran home crying like a bitch and her dad ran out and grabbed me, shaking me, asking if i hit her etc. I told him i did.  this was at the school bus stop and the buss rolled up then. we got on and he ran up to my house and i assume started yelling at my dad.  anyway. got to school and was called to the principals office. they were reading me the riot act about hitting girls etc. i told them about her chasing my sister with a stick and it all blew over.  when i got home my dad sat me down and told me i did a good thing. you always protect your family. it is paramount to almost everything. including hitting some dumb bitch if that&#039;s what it takes.  so lets get a thread going with glorious examples.

Ok, so Ive always wondered this, you know how (it seems like) time goes faster when youre unconcious? Well this got me thinking, if you were to compare two people perception at the same time (this all purely hypothetical), but one of the perceptions was unconcious for a period of time and the other was not, then wouldnt the person who was unconcious be ahead in time then the person who wasnt? For example, in a dream it might seem like an hour has passed and you wake up but to the other person it has been ten hours. This also gave me another thought, how can this be proved or disproved, if reality is based on perception and two perceptions are different which one is real? Ive also from time to time wondered if there was any other perception, or if Im the only one. There is no way to prove this either. My brain is just fabricating the whole universe. So, what happens if I die? Does my brain just make a new universe or what? Ive been wanting to find out, /b/.

In February I started the Witcher Saga facing the fate and destiny. After losing my memory I awoke in Kaer Morhen which was subsequently attacked Some documents featuring Witcher secrets that should best be forgotten had escaped and I was tasked with retrieving them. Eventually I found the culprit to be the Grand Master of the Order of The Flaming Rose who I faced and defeated and then was challenged by King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin. Impressed, King Foltest requested I stay in his company after saving his life. Beginning in March, my cozy life of serving the king had come to an end when a fellow took his life in a chaotic siege. Charged with his murder I was put in a position where finding his killer would be in my best interest. I was lead to Loc Muinne where I discovered the masterminds of the assassination and met face to face with my prey and made the mistake of letting him speak. We parted ways only to have this investment pay off later. After much time on the Path, in June I saw one final adventure awaited me. I was contracted by the Emperor of Nilfgard to track down his daughter, or better known to me as my adopted daughter and ward, Ciri who was being chased by my old opponent, Eredin. Tracking her began a long road of events that led me through Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige, almost a trip to Ofier, and an unnecessary excursion to Tousaint. Along the road I met old friends and made new ones until finally I found my dear Ciri. After much planning it was determined that a trap was to be set for Eredin.

And, before, there were very few ways to disrupt this image, to give it a good hard kick in the shins. And then Boxxy came along. Boxxy love is everything /b/ hates \u2014 passive, gentle, adorable, sweet. It gives without asking, it loves without asking in return. Instead of being aggressively faux-adult, it\u2019s happily faux-childlike. That\u2019s why Boxxy became a meme \u2014 because she DIDN\u2019T want the attention; because she provided no pics (as the /b/tards will attest). As a result, Boxxy turned into the most successful way to troll the /b/tards ever devised. It actually makes the gore and violence and sexism and racism fantards squeal, because it hits them where it hurts \u2014 in their image of themselves.

I met this girl from tinder about 1 month after we matched because she was out of town, it was all very sex-based from the beginning and she was always really slow at answering, sometimes shed answer a day after. Anyhow we meet at a park just to talk and drink and after about 40 mins we go to her car after making out and stuff at the park, in her car we stay for about 4 hours till after midnight more or less just having sex. Ive done this before with girls but it was something with this one that was very captivating and mesmerizing for me, she was my ideal girl in terms of looks and her submissiveness, just the things she said in the car and the way she moved and so on, maybe it was her tattoos or alternative/mysterious/grunge style and personality, i really dont know. while in the car i noticed she got a lot of phone calls and texts and that she even then said that she is not a texter and all that. Id really like to see her again and i asked her if she wanted to hang out for my birthday and we said a lot of things we would do &quot;next time&quot;, i do know that she really liked me though because of the things she said and always tried to get back to making out with me even though i had to go, i asked if she does this with other guys too and she said no. this was about 4 days ago and none of us have texted each other, i really do would like to get to know her better, but shes not that kind of a girl so im figuring if i should just text her next week and ask if she wants to hang out for the weekend, i just cant let go of her i came off as this really douchy guy because im good at playing games, but in reality im super sensitive as you can tell. pic not related", "threadId": "701938977"}, {"teaser": "Were evolution real, we would see all sorts of different forms of humans as they progress in evolution.

Durak (polish for idiot): Works best with 4 or more players. It can be played with as many decks (from two to ace, no jokers) as you&#039;d like to, we usually use 2, but that can be varied up to personal taste. The goal of the game is to get rid of your cards either in the first round, or when all cards of the deck were beaten. In this game there is no winner but only one looser - the durak. The durak will shuffle the cards for the next round. Optionally only call him durak while he is. 1. Hand out cards: Depending on the amount of decks and personal taste. I&#039;ll explain with two decks: Each person gets 10 cards,after that one card is turned arround and put beneath the stack of cards. This determines the trump. The trump (let&#039;s say a heart 7) can beat any non trump. (A heart two can beat an ace of spades and so on.) Otherwise you can only beat a card if you have a higher value of the same symbol. You may add a rule if the cards weren&#039;t mixed properly and someone has for instance 7 or more cards of the same symbol that the durak must mix again because he obviously fucked up. 2. Attack phase: The first person has to attack his left neighbor by playing at least one card. Cards of the same value MAY be played at the same time but they don&#039;t have to be played. (It&#039;s usually a good idea to keep trumps till the end of the game exept you&#039;re just about to get rid of all cards in the first round.) The attacked person must either beat or forward them to his own left neighbor. Forwarding can be done in two ways: Playing a card of the same value as the attacker played or showing the trump of the same value on your hand. A trump may only be shown once per round (if the forwarding goes on till it reaches the same person again), but the person may still play the trump.

She was beautiful, witty, and graceful young woman who light was snuffed out far too early. I frequently fantasize about being Peter van Pels hiding with her. Oh god, just imagine deflowering that sweet girl on a lazy Amsterdam afternoon, lying and learn what each other&#039;s bodies were for. Now imagine nine months later, she&#039;s got a massive bulging stomach from carrying your child inside of her and it seems like she\u2019s gonna pop any moment now. Her popped belly button makes it look like she&#039;s got a giant third boob where her stomach once was. She waddles around and can barely move half of the time. She&#039;s developed an insatiable craving for your dick and you&#039;ve likewise developed a taste for her pussy. You\u2019re both cooped up in an attic all day have nothing better to do besides fuck like an unsustainable third world population. You lie down on your back, she strips off her almost comically too small clothes and kneels on top of you. She grabs a hold of your rock hard cock, inserts it deep inside of her, and begins to ride you like a stallion. You feel the pressure from her incredible weight and huge round belly bearing down on you but the indescribable pleasure of her tight pussy throbbing on you cock negates any discomfort. You sink into her beautiful soul, into that secret place where no one dares to go. After 30 minutes, you and her are both moaning with ever greater intensity, you know it won&#039;t be long now. Suddenly, you feel your cock shaking like a V-2 rocket and the orgasm reaches it&#039;s climax as your cum literally explodes like an 88mm AT round inside her Sherman tank, blowing the turret right off. You and her both join as one, souls screaming from the sheer ecstasy. As the elation wears off, she lies next to you. Too exhausted to do anything else, you simply hold her in your embrace. In that moment, there is no family squabbles, no Nazis, no war.

I do realise that the vast majority here comprises of nihilists, suicidals and people generally dead inside, yet I decided to write anyway, as if there&#039;s one aspect most of 4chan still holds in high regard, it would be the truth. http://kontrowersje.net/blogi/matkakurka The link above leads to a blog site of a person known as Matka Kurka (mother hen), or Piotr Wielgucki, as he is called in real life. This guy, apart from being an ultimate amoral pussy as far as his own blog is concerned*, has gone to great lengths to destroy one of the best music festivals in Europe, and certainly the biggest and most freedom-oriented music festival in Poland. Woodstock, the music festival I&#039;m writing about, has been here for last 22 years, giving people from all over the world (approx. 1mln partakers each year) one week in a year, where they could honestly fuck merkel, fuck trump, fuck the arguments about lgbt, fuck sandniggas, fuck everything that concerns a sentient person and just chill. Together with our right-wing politicians, Piotr Wielgucki does his best/worst to kill the festival, just because of his animosities toward the organiser.  I am fairly aware that 4chan isn&#039;t some private army, and I don&#039;t expect you to hack the shit out of him or something. All that would of course be appreciated, but if anything, just find me the address of the fucker. * namely: reaching &quot;fame&quot; by creating contests with prizes and not giving them afterwards to the winners (often banned and insulted); abusing his admin power to change the content of other blogs within his platform; copypasting articles from other platforms into his own, posing as the authors switched to his own. ps.
