All have sinned and therefore cannot enter into Heaven on their own accord Isaiah 53:6, \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; Romans 3:23, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d  Romans 3:10, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d 2. There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3. Jesus lived a sinless life and shed his blood on the cross so we could be forgiven. John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701509641"}, {"teaser": "lolicon thread", "threadId": "701510003"}, {"teaser": "Drawthread: Battlestation edition!", "threadId": "701510137"}, {"teaser": "What&#039;s this little guy&#039;s name?

I know now that you have to shower every day and brush your teeth and shit. However, I spent years never talking to girls because I was so self conscious. Now, when I&#039;m approached by a girl who is clearly interested in me, I&#039;m too much of an awkward faggot to make any meaningful conversation and they&#039;re completely turned off by my beta-ness. Even when they aren&#039;t, I&#039;m too afraid to bone them. Twice it happened where a girl had asked me to bang but I was too scared.

You can&#039;t control me!!!&quot; So I pushed it out. Hard. (I just couldn&#039;t take it anymore) It started coming out, the hole thing kept widening more and more. I felt like Satan was giving me anal sex (but I never did anal, so I wouldn&#039;t know how it feels, because I&#039;m not a homosexual). I felt sweat, I felt the heat, I felt blood and tears. I felt my head exploding. It just kept coming out without stop. I had to stop midway through and take a few breaths so I didn&#039;t faint. I pushed more. It just wouldn&#039;t stop. Finally it ended. It was glorious. I heard The Grim Reaper enter the bathroom to take me out, but he immediately regretted entering.

My thought is, for every fuckstick who wants to go to college, or wants to have some sort of mildly livable income, with minimal effort on their part - what if we ran a scam on youtube? Users create a channel, upload whatever bullshit they feel like creating, whether it&#039;s actual decent content, or a video explaining why their favorite pony is the best pony, we all subscribe to each others channels, then the creator uploads all of their videos into playlists on their channel so we can play their channels in their entirety endlessly, adding to their view count and upping their page on Google/Youtube search engines?

So we&#039;ve been meeting up a few times but last week I couldn&#039;t control myself and kissed her. That went from kissing to fingering.  Now yesterday at like 3pm I got to fuck her and we both know, like and trust each other but she doesn&#039;t want to commit to a relationship with me because she is going to start at an other school as I am. But yesterday at around 11pm I met up with her again and we were talking about getting into a relationship with each other but she lowkey still has feelings for that other guy. &gt;She knows I&#039;m in love with her.

I&#039;m talking about the right to service and the right to (refuse) service.  On the one hand, If I&#039;m a business owner, I feel like I should have the right to do business with who I please how I please, and the same should apply to the customer. A transaction is more than an exchange, it&#039;s an agreement TO exchange on certain terms, and if that agreement cannot be made neither can the exchange. I don&#039;t feel like the government should be able to force you to work for someone you don&#039;t want to, especially if your objection to working for them is rooted in your beliefs.  Yet at the same time, from no matter what perspective I look at it from, It just feels wrong to give anyone the cold shoulder when they want something I have and they need, and they&#039;re willing to make a fair exchange for it. It feels just as wrong to have to stand idly by and watch someone, especially someone I know, be treated that way, and even worse to have to accept being treated in such a manner myself. If a black woman needs food to feed her family, or a repair on her car to get to work, and she&#039;s worked hard to earn the money necessary to pay for all those things, why shouldn&#039;t she be able to get them the same as anyone else?

That much is evident. However, there are definitely content creators still making a living, putting out videos. However many views = however many dollars (or cents, or cents on the cent) that counts for, so still, some channel with enough content can make a decent income. As raging /b/tards, I know you guys are a bunch of fucking NEET faggots with your piss jars and shit buckets, shitposting away and jerking it to whathaveyou all day, not contributing to society in anyway, and being generally poor and/or broke. (Obviously not the case for everyone, just you in particular.) My thought is, for every fuckstick who wants to go to college, or wants to have some sort of mildly livable income, with minimal effort on their part - what if we ran a scam on youtube? Users create a channel, upload whatever bullshit they feel like creating, whether it&#039;s actual decent content, or a video explaining why their favorite pony is the best pony, we all subscribe to each others channels, then the creator uploads all of their videos into playlists on their channel so we can play their channels in their entirety endlessly, adding to their view count and upping their page on Google/Youtube search engines?

The resistance, led by Princess Leia, set up their new base on the ice planet Snoth. The first orders fleet, led by kylo ren, continues to hunt for the Resistances\u2019 new base by dispatching recon droids across the galaxy. While investigating a potential meteor strike, Rey is captured by a mambo. She manages to escape from its cave with her lightsaber, but soon collapses because of the cold temperatures. The ghost of her late mentor, han solo, instructs her to go back to the cliffhanger system to train under Jedi Master Luke. She is found by Finn, who uses the warmth of his dead jubnub to keep Rey warm while he sets up a shelter. Finn and Rey make it through the night and are rescued by Poe Dameron. On patrol, Finn and Chewbacca discover the meteor Rey had planned to investigate is actually a recon droid, which alerts the first order to the Resistances location.

I recently changed to an anti-hair loss shampoo, used twice, hair is very unhealthy and I&#039;m not noticing much change, the bottle was saying the changes occur in 4 months of regular usage. I went to a dermatologist a year ago, for acne. The doctor noticed my hairline and told me to avoid pulling my hair back, nothing more. Every bit of advice is appreciated.

Just wanted to warn everyone that there&#039;s a disgusting pervert on the loose, going after girls north of campus (not sure if that&#039;s what he&#039;s limiting himself to). I was walking my dog on Tom Green st. (between 31st and 32nd st) around 4:00pm when this guy rolled up in a silver sedan. He kinda rolled the window down and asked me if I knew how to get to Guadalupe. Let me tell you, I gave him some detailed ass instructions, signaling which way to go after w/e street for like FIVE minutes. Anyways, while I&#039;m talking, he rolls his window down all the way and I see him literally stroking his penis with a smile on his face. I&#039;m like, &quot;Are you fucking serious?!&quot; and I hurried away. He didn&#039;t even try to rush off, he slowly left, and while I tried to make out his license plate number, I could barely read it. It was one of those paper ones, but I have a feeling that it could very much be a fake license plate, especially because it wasn&#039;t covered in plastic or anything. I reported it to the cops and apparently this happened to two other girls nearby TODAY. So yeah. Fuck that guy. If you see any suspicious activity involving a silver sedan (no tints on his windows) with a paper license plate without any plastic covering, and also happen to see the guy&#039;s face too (he&#039;s black, bald ish, looks about 25-30 years old, kinda fit kinda average built, and obviously, no pants) please report it and post in this thread or satan will come ass fuck you and kill your family in their sleep.

I need to get something off my chest. It&#039;s been almost exactly 10 months since I&#039;ve last seen her. I had a pretty fucked up life in general, which in turn messed me up in the head. I&#039;ve been obsessing over this one woman for almost a year now. Let&#039;s just say she was the only person with whom I ever felt a real and honest connection. Some shit happened since then, my best and only friend turned out to be a backstabbing fuck who deserves to die for what he&#039;s done, and then I got my iris (yes, in the eye, left to be specific) slashed open at my small birthday party by my drunk colleague who always uses very vivid gestures and doesn&#039;t like to cut his nails. If I wasn&#039;t drugged out of my mind on painkillers, it hurt like hell. Having your eye fucked up like that is an another dimension of physical pain, and it lasted for weeks. I&#039;ve tried moving on, but I can&#039;t stop thinking and the racing thoughts every night. Loneliness is killing me. I look like a regular dude, I act like a regular dude, but I feel like I&#039;m going insane whenever I&#039;m left alone with my thoughts, like my brain is telling me &quot;at this rate you&#039;ll end up in an asylum or hanging from a noose.&quot; I blame and hate myself for my life, but it&#039;s completely irrational, because I had no influence over majority of fucked up happenings. I&#039;m not going to list any, it just seems like I was born under some extremely unlucky star. In the last 9 months there were maybe 10 days when I fell asleep sober, and I am not joking when I name a number that low. Sometimes it&#039;s booze, sometimes it&#039;s weed, there was also lots of medicine. It doesn&#039;t matter what fucks me up, it just has to fuck me up. I posted here about a month ago asking for advice on serotonine syndrome, which I acquired by being retarded and overdosing and mixing antidepressants. That was fucking terrible.

I won&#039;t say I&#039;m some personal fitness guru or some shit but I know this one diet/eating habit that works for basically anyone.

You can eat about anything for dinner, and when you&#039;re asleep you are not able to eat for the average 7-9 hour sleep period, so you have that time to burn fat and the whole day to burn fat while doing whatever it is you do. When you&#039;re hungry you just drink a lot of liquids and your stomach will perceive that as you being full, so basically you won&#039;t be hungry but it&#039;s still necessary to eat dinner. Really helps, my friend lost a lot of weight in a two month time frame. He went from like 220 to 180, basically you&#039;re just not eating every meal and just drinking a lot of liquids when you get hungry.

There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3. Jesus lived a sinless life and shed his blood on the cross so we could be forgiven. John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701611677"}, {"teaser": "2211 Wyoming street, baytown tx My address bros I hate my life and want to be shot by swat team", "threadId": "701611694"}, {"teaser": "How does this make you feel /b/", "threadId": "701611752"}, {"teaser": "209 noodz gimme em", "threadId": "701611804"}, {"teaser": "/b/ is a Trump board right?

The reason we don&#039;t know that much about the family, is because the parents don&#039;t even speak a real language. They speak a broken Spanish/Kaqchikel mix. Not only that, but the kid doesn&#039;t even speak a language! The kid grunts and doesn&#039;t even know how to pinch things (basically, as a child, you learn how to pinch things with your index and thumb, instead of grabbing with your fist. We gave the kid candy and he grabbed it with his fish and shoved it into his face, instead of picking it up normal, like a high school kid). In fact, the kid is so foreign to society that he ran up to a blonde white girl, and yanked on her hair, because he&#039;s never seen it before. So in turn, its now my job to teach this kid how to act, kind of like a dog. So i&#039;m here to ask you, what should I teach this kid?

He hoped the droid hadn&#039;t purchased the whole night. He re-checked the credit balance--sure enough, ten credits, just enough for a mark. &quot;Stick it up your socket,&quot; he beeped. The droid didn&#039;t understand Mech, only Standard, so R2 was indulging himself with insults. &quot;A brain the size of a planet and where does it get me? Nowhere.&quot; The droid sat dejectedly on the bench. Great circuit above. At least C3PO shut up long enough to have sex. This droid&#039;s mark was half-consumed by his whinging. His poor sweet C3PO. The commanders didn&#039;t understand their relationship and insisted on assigning them separately. He hadn&#039;t gotten any word of the mission 3PO was on before he&#039;d been sent off himself. His current mission had stranded him on Beta Noorn, resourceless, with an entire division of Empire soldiers hunting him.

With the skill honed thousands of times before, I began to twist the sensitive nerves, covered in flesh and skin. The fabric of time and space ripped as he roared in agony, I felt his inner child weep within his soul as his very life-essence was being suctioned from his body via his teet.

I think Donald Trump is kind of finished. - The main reason I say this is because his strategy was always to be untouchable. If anyone attacks Trump; Trump destroys them without limits.  Apparently they were losing in media polls because of this. Trump did defend himself by doubling-down and saying he was attacked. Trump also countered by saying that this is also a campaign against the crooked media.  What I admired about Trump from the start is that he is such a unique voice in politics. It really reminds me of the 1700&#039;s, 1800&#039;s, or early 1900&#039;s - in terms of being real and talking like a real person. Instead of so-called &quot;politically correct&quot; trash.  By going in this direction of attempting to adjust to get as many votes as possible - as opposed to telling the truth and seeing how many votes you get - it is apparently so their main difference, strategy, and appeal is lost.  So. I&#039;m not sure what will happen now. To be honest it sort of went from &quot;hope&quot; to &quot;no hope&quot;. &quot;We&#039;re going to be real and fix everything&quot; to &quot;We&#039;re going to be fake and break everything&quot;.

I was terrified and without thinking, I jumped on the nigger and plunged the dagger ten or twelve times in the chest, and the nigger stopped moving and breathed one last growl drowned and died.

Its been about a month and a half, and I still am questioning my actions in this, and probably will until the day I die. In short, I lost the love of my life because of bigotry on the part of her grandparents.  First, a little background so we can all appreciate just what pieces of shit her grandparents were; She has previously told me what she is comfortable being shared, and what she is not. Keep in mind, this is not the full story; she has had a hard life, and some of that is private, which I 100% respect, and thus will not be sharing in a public setting. Her mother was 15 when she was born; her father was 20. Her grandparents pushed charges on her father, despite the fact it was 100% consensual, and destroyed his life because they didnt approve of a minor age difference. He didnt actually serve time, but they successfully stole every parental right he had from him, and got him on a sex offenders registry. He eventually put his life together, but he wanted nothing - absolutely nothing - more than to be in his daughters life. Im sure anyone here can appreciate that. Eventually, it all became too much for him, and he intentionally caught HIV and refused to take medication because he thought he had so failed his daughter, the woman I love, that he deserved a torturous death. She never met her father. Her grandparents were viciously abusive to her mother, her mothers two sisters, and her mothers brother. Grandfather was a high ranking cop in Dallas (in charge of narcotics), and because of that, despite multiple CPS calls to their house (over 20), nothing was ever done to protect any of them. Her grandparents kept their children in a cage; they werent allowed to move out on their own. every single one of them had to sneak out in the middle of the night when they eventually left.  pic related, my angel", "threadId": "701623615"}, {"teaser": "ben is an enormous faggot", "threadId": "701623642"}, {"teaser": "&gt;singles drink a shot of water &gt;dubs drink a glass &gt;trips drink a gallon  &gt;quads quit 4Chan forever", "threadId": "701623658"}, {"teaser": "Anyone have a Pdf. of this book?

Yesterday night I went to a party where I was really disgusted and bored, so I started to drink like crazy and suddenly lost the control of any of my actions, as usually when you get pretty booze. The thing is when I was in this state, a hot girl approached to me and conviced me to go to her room where she said had a surprise for me. I went there expecting to fuck her like it was her last day or even get dunno a trio with her girlfriend? But this won&#039;t happen or at least not as I expected. When I arrived there the girl told me to get nude, so I did and then she tied me to the bed. I was thinking that she could like it rough, you know... some kind of sadomasochist girl, but the girl had a little surprise, when she get undressed I discovered a /REALLY/ big surpise of about 20cm. I was thinking like &quot;holly shit, that&#039;s even bigger than mine&quot; and start tightening my ass, just in case and thinking &quot;If the balls don&#039;t touch it&#039;s not gay&quot; but it use to happen that she wasn&#039;t how to say that... pasive? She started liking my ass and then started to fucking my ass with that huge cock of her, he, whatevah... At the begining I started crying and yelling, but in some time I just stoped and try to let my body flow so it would finish &quot;easier&quot;. When the trany was going to finish, she approached to my mouth and started to facefuck my mouth and at the time another trany, this time with what It must be called as a monster cock (about 27cm huge fat rock solid black cock) started to fuck my ass to untill the first finished in my mouth and the second one in my ass. My ass was bleeding, mixed with the cum of the ebony one. The &quot;girls&quot; where laughing evily sawing my face of pain, kissing between the two and then letting me fuck the white one (of course still being tied) untill I was going to cum where she stoped, put her mouth and then kissed me to make me swallow my cum.

Humans are going to be extinct in the next 200 years. There won&#039;t be any colonies on the moon or Mars. I can prove it. I have two reasons. The first is a logic conundrum.  Imagine that you have the birth of every human represented by a stone. From the beginning of time to the end of time. Everyone human born has a stone. Every generation as a colour. The first generation is, say, blue. There are only a few of those stones. The first group of humans were a small one. The last generation is a red stone. There are many of those.  Let&#039;s look at it logically. Your birth is like taking a stone from the bag that contains all human births. What&#039;s the odds of you taking a stone from the first generation? Very very small. Every generation since the first has expanded in number. Even today, every generation has been greater than the last. It stands to reason that the last generation of humans shall be the biggest.  That makes it more likely that if you were born in a random generation, you were born in the last one. Since you are a random birth, it stands to reason that you are apart of the most populous generation, that is, the last one.  The next bit of evidence is the Fermi Paradox. Some old faggot named Fermi said that if the sky is full of stars and planets, how come we don&#039;t see any life out there? He&#039;s right. Why don&#039;t we? If you make a self-replicating probe (called a von Neumann probe) it takes under a million years to have a probe in every system with only the cost of the first probe. We can make one now if we wanted to. Since the Earth has gone through so many extinction events, it stands to reason with the billions of worlds in the Galaxy, one lifeform made a probe millions of years ago. But we haven&#039;t seen any. There are no probes here. If billions of civilisations haven&#039;t made a probe, it means that NO civilisations will make a probe. Since we&#039;re capable now to make such a probe, we must die very quick.  200 years, we die Bet on it.", "threadId": "701624719"}, {"teaser": "20 mins ago active shooter at LAX airport hasn&#039;t hit national news yet. http://ktla.com/2016/08/28/lax-closed-to-incoming-traffic-due-to-police-activity-airport-police/", "threadId": "701624748"}, {"teaser": "/b/ whats the secret formu-oli?", "threadId": "701624797"}, {"teaser": "shop away", "threadId": "701624858"}, {"teaser": "Explain to me how vaping isn&#039;t gay. &gt;Protip: You Can&#039;t", "threadId": "701624860"}, {"teaser": "I&#039;ve been trying lately to score some free food in a more roundabout way than just being an ass hole and complaining my way to it.

Here&#039;s the part that pisses me off; I feel trapped within AA. Because I am getting to the point where it&#039;s time to start thinking about moving out, and I have been thinking about AA while independent a lot. I think I may have overreacted. I was not dying from an addiction, I just didn&#039;t know how to get off xans by myself and needed some help. I am young and don&#039;t want to be sober forever, but if I leave my parents would know since they are in the program. SO I am not sure how to approach my parents, if at all once I move out.

I don&#039;t remember anything abnormal about him yesterday and today I could visually see his lower left jaw sagging and swollen and he recoils from touching it- it seems to hurt him. When I got back from Iraq I had a lot of issues and this cat has helped me open up again and helps me when I have anxiety issues. He is my boy. I found him outside, skinny, eating grass, and brought him in to feed him. He was and still is the sweetest boy you&#039;ll ever see. He&#039;s never been mean to anyone or anything. I don&#039;t know what to do. My vet&#039;s clinic doesn&#039;t open for another 5 hours and I&#039;m a mess. My face hurts. My head hurts. All I can think about is losing my little guy.

There&#039;s also the name: what&#039;s the Weasley dad&#039;s first name? Arthur Weasley, wait, what? That sounds familiar, almost like...Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington &amp; member of a prominent Anglo-Irish family, the Wellesleys. The Weasleys are a pure-blood family, but viewed as inferiors, almost like muggle-borns, by Malfoys, a family that is curiously similar to the stereotypical English nobles who are in love with their own noble birth &amp; despise anyone who sympathises with those who they themselves view as inferior people (like the Irish), and as such they tend to treat Anglo-Irish as if they were 100% Irish. Other connection to Ireland are also drawn, especially in the movies, and I am not even talking about Weasleys cheering for the Irish team during Quiddich World Cup. Remember the falling-out Harry and Ron had later during the movie, who did Ron hang out with when ever Harry and Ron ran into each other?

I&#039;ve got something for you. I want to start a project. Inb4 excuse my english. Im an 26 year old german ingenieur, and im crazy about drones. So here is my idea, (I will call it Drone Agent or &quot;/b/s drone soldier&quot; or something like that, idk you decide), i know you guys like to be entertained and I think I can offer this. I own like 30+ drones but for this project I will build a special one. It will be extremely resistant to anything that could influence it (water / dust / strong wind etc) also it will have a very expensive HD camera which also has a night vision feature. Also it has a modified reciever which is controlled by a mobile internet device so i can control it in nearly every place on the world. Already got the internet contract which was pretty expensive but lol idc. The most important feature will be the solar panels on top, which can charge the battery to full, when under full sunlight in 8-10 hours which is enough for 4 hours in darkness or 6 hours at daylight. So when i finished the build, i will create monthly a thread in /b/ where quads decide what my drone agent should do. For example you want me to fly to north korea and spy it. Ofc it will take more then a week to go there, and for charging i need to land it in a hidden place where it stays for a day, but i will stream it all live. Also possible is you want me to fly to iraq / syria and kill a terrorist or something but for this we need an idea of a lightweight weapon i could attach and trigger remotly which is deadly. Tell me if you guys would be interested in that, also if you are i need your advice how to post / stream completely anonymous, because this is illegal af. For now only targets in europe or land connected to europe are possible, cause i cant fly it over the ocean but if i find a trustworthy /b/ anon, i could send him a second drone so we have an US agent too.", "threadId": "701668967"}, {"teaser": "Rate my gf&#039;s bod Also gf thread", "threadId": "701669077"}, {"teaser": "What is the best way to ask to eat a girl out?
