My friend was really high and I had to take care of him. Lots of hugging and lots of water. When we got to the new club, I got a message from a guy that I know from my childhood. This is a man in his fifties who molested me. Eventhough this happened, I have always stayed in contact with him. He asked me to come over to his place to suck his cock. I left my friend and went over to his place. When I arrived, he was already naked. He forced me on my knees and shoved his cock in my mouth.

Im 33. I make 100K a year as a software tech lead. I have a beautiful wife. I have beautiful, kind, non-annoying children. I have no debt except my 5 year old 2000 square foot house I got for 180 and still owe 160 on and a new 4Runner for about 30. We have no CC debt and no more student loans. My house payments are 1500 a month and i bring in over 5000 a month after taxes. I have slept with numerous beautiful women in my life, by looks alone they should be out of my league. I am not good looking, although I am not unattractive albeit a bit overweight (im American so fuck off, Im working on it). I have a 6 inch dick, so no problems there, even if Im not huge, I am big enough to get 100% repeat customers because I eat the pussy quite well. I never really had to worry about money. My parents were upper middle class to lower upper class citizens. They paid for most of my college degree...and it took me 6 years to get the degree, and i fucked around and partied for 2 years. Then i was able to get a computer science degree from a very good program in the Big XII without studying for anything except a few upper level CS courses. My wife is not a 10. She is a solid 6 and cool as hell. But the kicker is she likes to bring other women home, so that ups her a bit in my book since we can bring home 9s and 10s together. So yes, i get to fuck 9s/10s on a semi regular basis, although not of my own merit. My kids are testing at a 3-4 year old level for shape matching and language skills at the age of 20-22 months. Let that sink in. My children are smarter than the average 3-4 year old before they turn 2. While your kid is putting together their first sentences, my children are able to hold a full conversation. I am 100% happy. I have a perfect life. Then I measured my girth last night. 2.9&quot; Now nothing else matters. Should I kill myself? My life feels like a lie.

Okay, the first thing id like to bring up is that we have had an exceptionally strong year. I want to give kudos to marks team, the harambe meme was a massive hit and is still raking in views. It has even splintered, and its seeing some headlines with this new sex scandal that black girl had. Our other departments have been doing well too, er, tom its on again. No problem. Anyway, the reply or your mother dies meme has skyrocketed, were expecting harambe levels of exposure. Really well done gentlemen. Next, well... lets see.... Ah, right. We have a prototype meme on the table right now, uh, it looks like it has potential... Ah marks team again, well done you guys. Anyway its moved through the discussion phase and is now in an alpha form. Its uh.... right, its a picture of a dead raccoon with a sign behind it saying &quot;Coon lives matter&quot;. This highlights, uh, right, coon is a racial slur for &quot;black&quot;, and its parodying black lives matter. Obviously its going to be polished up, but... anyway this is the alpha image, its still in development. Id like to bring up a vote now and see if we should move forward with this, just email steven with your yay or nays... I suppose thats it for the coon lives matter meme, what else... Oh, to everyone going to japan for the meme convention, please be sure to email steven when youve successfully received your visa and passports. Lets see... Oh, to every member on the millhouse team, your project is going to be officially canceled next week.

I mentioned this when I got back, because I just thought it was a funny misunderstanding. My brother found this to be quite rude, he called it racist for my dad to say that. He considered it this because they are each their own individual culture (chinese people dont like japanese people, and koreans dont like them either, etc, etc) I chimed in and said that I wouldn&#039;t care if someone thought I was any other race, even if they weren&#039;t similar at all. I likened it to a Jewish person being called German, and how if I was Jewish, I don&#039;t think I would mind (even thought they are groups that has had conflict in the past). My brother said he didn&#039;t understand this, so for clarification, I asked what point he was trying to make in the first place. His response was &quot;check your privilege&quot;. He said that I wasn&#039;t Asian, and didn&#039;t live in an Asian culture, and that I was just some white kid from America, with straight parents in my own little world. The first thing I mentioned in response to this was, why does the sexuality of my parents even matter? I also mentioned that I was sure there were plenty of people in Asia that had a very similar lifestyle to me. I also said that regardless of where a person was from, I wouldn&#039;t treat them any differently. To which he replied that you would want to treat them the same, which I agreed with, and didn&#039;t really understand why those ideas were at odds with each other. Then I started to make fun of the very concept of checking ones privileged, to which the conversation descended into personal insults. Keep in mind that my brother was sick, and very tired at the time.

Over the last few weeks I&#039;ve been attempting to start at &#039;square 1&#039; and to try and taste my own cum, or beyond and actually play with. I&#039;ve attempted this about 5-6 times and bottled out at the last minute. That was until today, i though &#039;just go for it&#039;, I&#039;d planned ahead and not masturbated since last weekend and after watching hours of porn I finally did it. Most of it missed my mouth but went all over my face and hair, this in itself was a giant turn on, i then scooped it up and put it in my mouth - this time I was still hornier than ever, i spat it out on my dick and continued wanking (to go on and cum again several minutes later). Now I&#039;m not sure if this is normal (mentally to want to do this) so I&#039;m looking for advice. The next step now is to meet up with someone and at least attempt watching porn, handjob, blowjob then hopefully some cum play, I&#039;d love to be covered head to toe in someone elses cum. Two questions really, are there any bi UK anon&#039;s (preferably down south) under 30 that may be up for this?

So I have always saw myself as bisexual, wank to gay porn, find good looking men sexually attractive and so on. But tonight I sucked my first dick. It was a guy I met on craiglist. I started crying half way through but let me tell you what happened.  He picked me up in his work van, gave me some speed and poppers. That loosened me up, I&#039;m already on xanax so I think that might have been why I choose to suck a dick tonight. Don&#039;t laugh please. I do not know if I regret it.  We went to a discreet location and I rubbed his cock on the drive there (I&#039;m getting horny thinking about this which is why I am having doubts). So we get to the location and he gets me to suck his cock after taking more speed. The guy was 32, attractive for his age 6/10 but way under my league in no means to boast. He kept calling me a twink and using terminology I found unsettling. He turned out to be a nice guy he said he wanted to fuck me so hard because I was such a good cocksucker. It was great sucking his cock, I literally deepthroated it so many times and he said he was close to cumming three times but didn&#039;t because he didn&#039;t want to cum in my mouth. I loved sucking cock don&#039;t get me wrong but I found it more appealling when he sucked mine; even though he didn&#039;t suck it that much.

We&#039;re 30 now... that&#039;s half my life. We have a two year old and she&#039;s pregnant with the next kid which is a miracle in itself (she&#039;s was told she&#039;d never bear children at one point.)  I love her so much. She&#039;s an incredible person. An incredible wife, and a great mother. But our sex life has always sucked. She&#039;s borderlife, if not, asexual. I&#039;ve always pushed that aside because my love for her always meant more. As we grow older, and our careers and child rearing take more time I find that love fading, not due to me loving her less, but because there&#039;s not as much effort put into it. This fucks with me on so many levels. It makes me think about divorce even though my heart will always be hers, and I&#039;m so confused as to what to do. I was borderline divorce before she told me she was pregnant. I love my child (that I never wanted to begin with) so much I can&#039;t stand the idea of not seeing her everyday. I feel as if I&#039;m just stuck in this loop of sexual frustration and happiness and wrapped into this thing we call life.  I&#039;ve been drinking /b/. If I had the balls I&#039;d kill myself somehow inconspicuous and leave my wife the huge life insurance policies I have. I&#039;d never get to see my child grow up...and fuck I love her so much.

Then sometime after that she expressed interest in seeing me at university...but i&#039;ve texted her multiple times with either no response or a broad &quot;Im sorry Im busy&quot; answer.

Not sure /b/, or 4chan, is a good place to get support though. Seems like it&#039;s a bunch of assholes acting like they&#039;re alpha dogs. My first sexual experience was with a girl I met on okcupid, pretty quick after meeting her on there. There was so much new information all at once, I couldn&#039;t quite get into it, because I was so in my head. We gave up for that night. We met again the next night and it didn&#039;t really go any better. She wasn&#039;t really willing to keep trying after that. A year or so later I tried again with someone else I met online. It didn&#039;t go much better. What I learned was that I need more of an emotional connection with someone to be able to really enjoy sex with them. Things did go better a few years after that when I had an actual girlfriend for a few months. Something else those early experiences taught me was that worthwhile sex doesn&#039;t come easy for a socially withdrawn person like myself. I think having those early experiences made it easier to not care so much that I wasn&#039;t having sex like people and TV make it sound like other young people are doing all the time. Like, I tried it, learned it&#039;s not as easy as just having someone agree to do it with you, and was like &quot;oh okay. I&#039;m just not at that point in life yet.&quot; I consider myself mostly straight, but do sometimes want to do things with another guy, until I remember that most guys are total assholes, especially if you don&#039;t know them. So yeah that won&#039;t be happening anytime soon.

Not a thing that I\u2019m really proud of but I beCAME quite good at it. I was taking supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don\u2019t become a sex offender. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest. that was enough to fuel the fire but if you\u2019re not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you\u2019re good an horny you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your cock out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a dime at distances up to feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you\u2019re finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It\u2019s an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven\u2019t done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at some birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.", "threadId": "701475525"}, {"teaser": "Hey /b/.

Now that the ship is in position, it is the time to reveal our purpose and our mission. Beneath the Commonwealth, there is a cancer known as &quot;The Institute&quot;, a malignant growth that needs to be cut before it infects the surface. They are experimenting with dangerous technologies that could prove to be the world\u2019s undoing for the second time in recent history. The Institute Scientists have created a weapon that transcends the destructive nature of the atom bomb. They call their creation the &quot;synth&quot;, a robotic abomination of technology that is free-thinking and masquerades as a human being. This notion that a machine can be granted free will is not only offensive, but horribly dangerous. And like the atom, if it isn\u2019t harnessed properly, it has the potential of rendering us extinct as a species. I am not prepared to allow the Institute to continue this line of experimentation. Therefore, the Institute and their &quot;synths&quot; are considered enemies of the Brotherhood of Steel, and should be dealt with swiftly and mercilessly.

I&#039;d previously heard stories of seven great legions holding back an immeasurable furry horde for three days before divine judgement ripped them all asunder- both the hideous furry menace and the brave soldiers who&#039;d laid down their lives in defense of our beloved world.  I remember the great documentaries that worked to keep fresh the sting of our conflict against the beast with one red eye and one green, though the events themselves I wasn&#039;t old enough to enlist for. I remember being called a newfag and being told to lurk, to learn and not to engage in discussions before I understood what was being said. I remember gaiafags begging the senior officers to hack their friend&#039;s accounts, and themselves being hacked because we were an army that answered to no one man.  I was there when the first rules of law were slated in stone, and then almost immediately broken by everyone involved. At least, those laws which were actual laws, and not statements of fact and wisdom. My first major engagement was a now later derided attempt to wrest power from a batshit insane celebrity and the secretive cult he represented. Many of our number took to the physical streets, wearing masks from a comic book- more closely associating themselves to the hero who wore them than the person whose face they most resembled, not that any of them cared to admit this. I was too much of a coward to join them, not that I could have in any case, but I showed my support. Many of us thought the project was a failure, or was obnoxious.

It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan&#039;s Upper West Side in New York City (although taped entirely in Los Angeles), the show features a handful of Jerry&#039;s friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being &quot;a show about nothing&quot;, as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.[1] Seinfeld was produced by Castle Rock Entertainment. In syndication the series has been distributed by Sony Pictures Television since 2002. It was largely written by David and Seinfeld with script writers who included Larry Charles, Peter Mehlman, Gregg Kavet, Carol Leifer, David Mandel, Jeff Schaffer, Steve Koren, Jennifer Crittenden, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Dan O&#039;Keefe, Charlie Rubin, Marjorie Gross, Alec Berg, Elaine Pope, and Spike Feresten. A favorite among critics, the series led the Nielsen ratings in seasons six and nine, and finished among the top two (with NBC&#039;s ER) every year from 1994 to 1998. In 2002, TV Guide named Seinfeld the greatest television program of all time.[2] In 1997, the episodes &quot;The Boyfriend&quot; and &quot;The Parking Garage&quot; were respectively ranked numbers 4 and 33 on TV Guide&#039;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time,[3] and in 2009, &quot;The Contest&quot; was ranked No. 1 on the same magazine&#039;s list of TV&#039;s Top 100 Episodes of All Time.[4] E! named it the &quot;number 1 reason the &#039;90s ruled.&quot;[5] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America named Seinfeld the No. 2 Best Written TV Series of All Time (second to The Sopranos).[6] That same year, Entertainment Weekly named it the No. 3 best TV series of all time[7] and TV Guide ranked it at No. 2.[8]", "threadId": "701495320"}, {"teaser": "Moar from her?", "threadId": "701495344"}, {"teaser": "fb fap thread should i post more?", "threadId": "701495383"}, {"teaser": "Pernille blume thread  Give me all you got", "threadId": "701495445"}, {"teaser": "Here&#039;s a question I enjoy asking people, would you rather get fucked by a large Silverback Gorilla who has been starved of Sex, or fuck the household pet and as you ejaculate, your family works in on you.

It is the largest English speaking image board of its type. It is a website designed for adults only. The culture of 4chan is a deeply complicated one. It is Japanese themed and inspired. The boards were originally organized by letter, a b c and so on. /b/ was and remains the &quot;random&quot; board, which is by far the most visited board on the site, receiving as it does over 100,000 posts a day. However, it is nothing remotely like or related to Gaia. It really is an adult web site. The long running joke that has developed over the past 3 or so years is that everybody on the website, (well, on /b/ anyway) whilst ADULTS, and reasonably intelligent ones at that, engage in moronic activities verging on the utterly stupid. The joke being that everyone acts like the same retarded individual. WHILST KNOWING THAT THEY ARE NOT. The joke is in the delivery. The humor was fairly unique, and ridiculously complex and almost impossible to follow as a newbie. The problem that has blighted 4chan in recent years (and which really started to kick in about 2 or so years ago) is that newcomers to the site, usually heading to /b/ to see what the fuss is all about, see the retardedness of people acting like 14-year-olds, and then start thinking that indeed, the website is a place for 14 years olds to hang out and be retarded. This in turn lead to masses of underage users flooding the site. Recent media attention makes this problem increase. Eventually, so many 14-year-olds end up browsing the site that the original adult userbase has been overshadowed by the masses of underage people who have now turned the joke inside out, and the site has now literally become a place for 14-year-olds to be retarded. There are several problems with this. The first is that all the old populace of 4chan start whining about this very fact.", "threadId": "701498826"}, {"teaser": "post your personal arm", "threadId": "701498835"}, {"teaser": "Hey kinky /b/ros  I&#039;m 23/Male and I define myself as a switch, but I tend to lean submissive.  My girlfriend is a 21 year old model and actress (I&#039;m not trying to brag about this - I&#039;m just trying to give you guys something to work with). She&#039;s very confident, and it makes her fit the role of a domme very well.  She&#039;s a switch as well, and she leans dominant - so I&#039;m normally submissive to her. Lately, though, we&#039;ve been talking about exploring our opposite roles more.  Problem is - I&#039;m not really sure how to dominate her adequately.  When I&#039;m submissive to her, I treat her like a Goddess. I worship the ground she walks on, I bathe her, buy things for her, go anywhere and do anything, I eat her pussy and fuck her exactly how she wants to be fucked. We play around with aspects of cuckolding and forced bi in our sessions - but just fantasies.  When she wants me to dominate her, she wants me to be angry and feral. She wants me to make her life a living hell. She wants to be punished for even glancing at other men, and she wants to be humiliated and used.  I talked about financially dominating her (like she does me occasionally) and she said that was okay, but &quot;not intense enough&quot;. We talked about making her ride in her car with the temperature at extremes, and she liked that idea - but I needed to take more advantage of her and torture her in other ways.

Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701504568"}, {"teaser": "hey /b/ros if you had to describe the wonderful place of /b/ in one picture or gif what would it be?", "threadId": "701504571"}, {"teaser": "What&#039;s the difference between chubby and fat /b/?", "threadId": "701504619"}, {"teaser": "My mom&#039;s phone had some nudes on it.

Anyone read the book? &gt;Description: Thomas H. Burgoyne, an astrologer and founder of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, was born April 14, 1855, and grew up in his native Scotland. Spontaneously psychic, he claimed that as a child he came into contact with the Brotherhood of Light, a group of discarnate, advanced beings who attempt to guide the destiny of humankind. Today that group continues as the Church of Light. At a later date he met a M. Theon, purported to be an earthly representative of the brotherhood who taught Burgoyne about the Brotherhood. Burgoyne moved to the United States around 1880 and soon afterward his writings began to appear in various periodicals. He was brought into contact with Norman Astley of Carmel, California, who also claimed to be in contact with the Brotherhood of Light. Astley suggested that Burgoyne write a set of lessons to introduce the brotherhood&#039;s teachings to the public, and Burgoyne accepted Astley&#039;s hospitality at Carmel while he worked on the lessons. They were published in 1889 as &quot;The Light of Egypt.&quot; The writing of the lessons occasioned the establishment of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor as an esoteric occult order and outer expression of the Brotherhood of Light. The Hermetic Brotherhood was structured with three leaders, a seer, a scribe/secretary, and an astrologer. Burgoyne became the scribe. As Burgoyne understood it, the Brotherhood of Light was an occult order formed to oppose the dominant religious powers of the day in ancient Egypt. As the members died, they continued the brotherhood from their new plane of being.", "threadId": "701513948"}, {"teaser": "Let&#039;s make another Buzzfed Headlines Thread Show me your best /b/", "threadId": "701513953"}, {"teaser": "http://crushee.com/welcome &gt;http://crushee.com/welcome http://crushee.com/welcome &gt;http://crushee.com/welcome http://crushee.com/welcome &gt;http://crushee.com/welcome http://crushee.com/welcome &gt;http://crushee.com/welcome http://crushee.com/welcome &gt;http://crushee.com/welcome http://crushee.com/welcome &gt;http://crushee.com/welcome this is where we need to hit. crush dreams", "threadId": "701514039"}, {"teaser": "Third world Slav here.

Its been fun, the sex is great, even the cooking is good but other than when at work W. is usually around me, occasionally going back to own place.

Meanwhile I&#039;ve been seeing others, which W. became painfully aware of shortly ago. After picking up on others having swung by, W. threw a massive fit and disappeared for a while, but came back eventually. I thought we were clear that I didn&#039;t want any relationships at this time but W. doesn&#039;t get it.

Martial means war, which makes sense, but war has evolved much farther than using sharp or blunt weapons, let alone fists. Think about it: gorilla warfare has been around for the past hundred of years or more. Gorilla warfare may have hand-to-hand combat incorporated into it, but usually it involves using guns in hit and run tactics nowadays.  The Native Americans of long ago are great examples of gorilla fighters. It took an extra century practically to kill them off, even with, initially at least, superior weapons. At the battle of Little Big Horn, Custer and his men were slaughtered because the Native Americans had, not only numbers, but better rifles too. That&#039;s kind of on a tangent though because that really wasn&#039;t gorilla warfare in my opinion. Gorilla fighters even exist today in Africa. They can be found throughout Africa on raids destroying villages, raping women, and killing children. Often times, it is hard to find footage of these gorilla fighters because they are so sly. They have been portrayed in media though. Here is an example from memories of a survivor of a gorilla attack:  /watch?v=7VQ34YsPGW8 Anyways, back on the main topic, I think that the phrase &quot;martial arts&quot; is misused because gorilla fighters who use ranged weapons exist today. The armies that do exist today do not, in large part use, Muay Thai fighters who use elbows and fists, not the legions of Rome (they were in large part successful because they had each soldier carry multiple pilum into battle http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilum) who mostly used shield and gladius, nor the masterfully crafted katana of the samurai which, like many of their noodles, have been folded thousands of times.
