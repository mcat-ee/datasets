Help me understand your cullture. When I came to Europe to collect some of my countries stolen welath in the form of welfare, I thought it would be the easiest form of Jihad imaginable, but boy was I wrong. Western culture is far more toxic than I had ever imagined. Day after day I see westerners, even children, forced into accepting sick and dangerous values such as cuckery, feminism, anti-self defence, homosexuality, rape culture, affirmative action, BLM, white-race hate, love of money, socialism/fascism, gluttony, obesity, anti-intellectualism, anti-vaccines, beastiality, genderfluidity/attraction to inanimate objects, &quot;peace&quot;, &quot;love&quot; and &quot;tolerance&quot;, political correctness... the list goes on and on. Do you really enjoy these things?!! What a sick and twisted place! As soon as the caliphate is established and the western coalitions are defeated, I&#039;m moving back to a Muslim society. I don&#039;t want to get AIDS or have my children see any part of this cesspool of a civilization... It is my duty to ensure our small Muslim majority town remains a no-go zone to the western natives. Islam is a religion of peace that can free you from the burdens of such a toxic and inferior system. Islam is the perfect system for all mankind. Why not come to Islam?

I&#039;ve never posted anything remarkable or contributed to anything funny to the board, I just see it as an occasional pastime, secret shame and something to go to for a good giggle, until now, I guess. To give some personal background; I&#039;m a 24 male, living in Melbourne, Australia. I have a fantastic friends group, a gorgeous girlfriend and a supportive family, and this is why I&#039;m so fucking confused.  My younger brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia last year after a break down. He was placed in a psych ward for a month, then placed on some medication until they finally deemed him well enough to function without. He was gorgeous, great at sport and a pretty likeable guy in highschool, but puberty hit him hard, he fell in with the wrong crowed resulting in some pretty hard drug usage. After the breakdown he was never the same. He didn&#039;t go out much, spent most of his time playing LOL, drinking and smoking.  To cut the details there, I was overseas with my girlfriend when we got the call; my brother had thrown himself in front of a train in the attempt to take his own life. I flew home, to find my brother, the kid I taught how to kick a football, the kid who slept in my room when he was scared and the kid that punched a doctor because he was giving me a syringe, was lying on a gurney, full of tubs, blue batted and bleeding. Tomorrow I have to say goodbye to him due to his head injuries and I&#039;m so fucking scared. I feel so numb, and broken and I can&#039;t talk to anyone about my emotions and I have no fucking idea why. I&#039;m reaching out to the anonymous, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m asking exactly.

I go upstairs and no one is in the house at all. Maybe they went outside? I go outside. No one anywhere. No neighbors, no cars, nothing, no one. I am alone in the world? Seriously freaking out now. I run down the street, take a look around at a few houses, run back to our friend&#039;s house, and still can&#039;t find a single person anywhere. Freaked out as fuck now. I think about the pole in the basement, and decide to run around the pole again in the opposite direction as I did the first time. I do it, and about 2 times around, I notice the TV and stop. I listen and I can hear my parents and their friends talking upstairs. I go upstairs and everyone is there. WTF? I ask them if they went outside, and they said no, we&#039;ve been here talking.

Are you absolutely sure there is no God? If not, then is it not possible that there is a God? And if it is possible that God exists, then can you think of any reason that would keep you from wanting to look at the evidence? 2. Would you agree that intelligently designed things call for an intelligent designer of them? If so, then would you agree that evidence for intelligent design in the universe would be evidence for a designer of the universe? 3. Would you agree that nothing cannot produce something? If so, then if the universe did not exist but then came to exist, wouldn\u2019t this be evidence of a cause beyond the universe? 4. Would you agree with me that just because we cannot see something with our eyes\u2014such as our mind, gravity, magnetism, the wind\u2014that does not mean it doesn\u2019t exist? 5. Would you also agree that just because we cannot see God with our eyes does not necessarily mean He doesn\u2019t exist? 6. In the light of the big bang evidence for the origin of the universe, is it more reasonable to believe that no one created something out of nothing or someone created something out of nothing? 7. Would you agree that something presently exists? If something presently exists, and something cannot come from nothing, then would you also agree that something must have always existed? 8. If it takes an intelligent being to produce an encyclopedia, then would it not also take an intelligent being to produce the equivalent of 1000 sets of an encyclopedia full of information in the first one-celled animal?

I must admit, I\u2019ve been lazy.  \u201cI don\u2019t need to socialize much, I\u2019ve got my bros!\u201d \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll get a start on my very own family soon!\u201d  These are examples of the bubbles that occupied my mind before the facade crumbled. So why am I specifically so alone? There\u2019s a collection of reasons, which I can list, but there\u2019s one underlying reason. I am a cowardly fool. Anyone with a sense of adversity would have overcame these obstacles and constructed a happy life out of the rubble. I did not. I avoided the obstacles in my life to protect my precious ego, which basically deteriorated anyway because I found myself in the kind of embarrassing situations that a bumbling sitcom buffoon would find himself in.", "threadId": "700371856"}, {"teaser": "what video have you fapped to the most times", "threadId": "700371899"}, {"teaser": "Who else hates the bit in Star Wars Episode V where Han Solo gets frozen in carbon**e (word censored due to trauma).

(I never saw the actual Carbon-Freezing scene because I ran away and hid in the toilet even before the part where Darth Vader was torturing Han Solo... (Thank God!).) I even wrote this FanFic called Escape from Carbon**e Island, even though it&#039;s unfinished and it depicts exactly what I think of carbon**e! I even wrote a poem based on another poem a little child wrote, so it&#039;s kind of childish in a way. The poem I wrote: Carbon**e, carbon**e traumatises me, carbon**e, carbon**e traumatises me. Now go, go, go away carbon**e, I don&#039;t want you in my house and if you say &quot;No, never,&quot; I will not tolerate you and I will kick you out because I never, ever, ever want to see you again, MATE!

And as such, I wouldn&#039;t have to do the melody on my (example:) piano. Now, for the question. What in the hell do you call a music sheet that only shows the notes and chords you have to play in the band? Like, when you listen to music, the guitar only does it&#039;s part. The bass only does the notes it&#039;s supposed to do. Whenever I try to search videos or music sheet on the only parts an instrument has to play, I fail miserably, because almost all of the stuff that comes up are melody included, which shouldn&#039;t have, because that&#039;s not what I&#039;m searching for.

I teach AP world history and 11 grade Social Studies btw.  My first period class is full of niggers and normies, so it&#039;s my second least least favorite class.  Second period is my favorite. It&#039;s also an AP class, I have these two guys that play Magic the Gathering after they finish assignments. I&#039;m thinking of joining them but I don&#039;t want to ruin their fun.  Third period is my least favorite, mainly because it&#039;s almost all normies. They spit chewing tobacco on the floor and bacically never do anything. I send 3 homework assignments this week, I have 24 people in that class. 3*24=72, so if expect at least 60 assignments back. I literally got 12 from that class.  Fourth period is my planning period.  Fifth comes right after junior lunch, so everyone from this point on is more hyper and energetic. Basically the only class other than my AP class I really like.  Sixth period I&#039;d also an okay class, the problem is this fucking tumblrfag that makes noises and tries to get attention.  Seventh period is my last class. They&#039;re kinda in three groups, the normies on one end of the class, complete fucktards on the other end, and these kinda &quot;holier than thou&quot; faggots on the other end. That end is my favorite, but they tend to tell a lot causing more disrubption than it stops.  So, I&#039;m in for a shit show.

After few hours of drinking one of the guys (let him be Elijah) asked me to Register him in The Meeting App. I Downloaded Badoo and he almost instantly got 4 girls riding a taxi to visit us.

So I felt a bit uncomfortable that evening. End of Flashback When 2 of the girls stayed, they demanded to go get some cigarettes and we got a little chat walk to the nearest 24 - hours market.

She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could eat in comfort again. I don&#039;t think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the McDonald&#039;s restaurant or drive through, but that is another story. I went to McDonald&#039;s for dinner tonight and got a McChicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. As I was driving to the second window the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked, &#039;why don&#039;t you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot where it is cold&#039;. That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don&#039;t want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy. Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don&#039;t think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?

Were attracted to each other. Even light-heartedly confessed to having sex dreams about the other. Close friends. &gt;My fuckbuddy and I had a hard break. She moved away w/ husband, and cut off all communication with everyone, including her best friend. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY: &gt;I have since left the old company, and no longer see the best friend. Has been a couple years. We email occassionally. &gt;The best friend emails me randomly about how she still gets angry and confused about why my fuckbuddy totally bailed on everyone. &gt;She emphasizes that she thinks I&#039;m a good person, and that she totally understands why I did what I did... &gt;Says she still thinks about me a lot. &gt;Brings up how close we were, and feels bad that it all disappeared. &gt;Asks if I have snapchat to talk about this more, away from work email... &gt;I responded by saying how highly I regard her. Admitted to thinking about her too, and gave her my snapchat name. &gt;I said that &quot;part of me was curious to know if she could truly get inside my head, would she still think I&#039;m a good person?&quot; -She added me on snapchat immediately after getting that email, but hasn&#039;t said anything else yet.

White people have forgot how to live in society. 6) We got rhythm. We can dance, rap, sing, make music, you name it! 7) A black chick wouldn&#039;t date a white boy. On the other hand, white girls would drop their white boyfriend anytime for a black guy if given the chance. 8) We&#039;re simply cooler. Admit it, maybe it wasn&#039;t the case some 200 years ago, but nowadays being white sucks whereas being black is cool as hell. 9) We got a sense of what family is about. 10) We get MANY children so that our genes will last long on this motherfucking earth, not like your average pathetic two children. 11) If you don&#039;t die a virgin, and happen to get a daughter...chances are she&#039;ll be sucking and swallowing black dicks :) I could be going on and on and on but you get the point by now.

I had a great Friday night with friends (with some chemical assistance, for the second time of my life); while chatting, I brought up the concept of honesty and I think I may have changed my concept of the world and myself completely forever. My realisation is that: 1. Everyone craves honesty. 2. We are dishonest to hide/conceal what makes us vulnerable. 3. People will use those vulnerabilities they find to control/manipulate for gain, that gain ultimately being used in turn to further conceal or find other vulnerabilities. 4. The other aspect of this is love - that is, willfully disclosing truth that makes you vulnerable BECAUSE you want that to be reciprocated and to show that you trust/respect someone. It&#039;s been two days and I have not stopped thinking about it even while stone cold sober. And honestly, unburdening myself is why I&#039;m posting and to get validation for my thoughts. So /b/, am I crazy or am I on to something? Be honest with me and yourself when you reply, it&#039;s the only thing that is literally true in life.

It trickled down her fat legs and onto the dirty white floor. The smell was horrid.

You see, a long time ago when we were fighting the British our brave soldiers would shart to confuse them. While the British were wondering what the hell was happening our brave men would come out from behind the foliage, with the freshly made shart leaking out of their assholes and dripping down their flabby legs and they&#039;d ambush them. The British never even stood a chance. Sharting can never be forgotten, it is the thing which this proud nation is built upon. It is an American Tradition.

During the first few years that I was assigned to work an area in SC, USA my field computer was stolen and my residence burned down. I proceeded to carry out my mission even though the alternate method of contacting the unit was no longer in existence. My initial thoughts were that I had either been disavowed and/or the Underground Church knew who I really was and what I was doing in their cult. Nevertheless, I continued climbing the proverbial ladder of the Underground Church. After years of doing this, and being exposed to their highly contagious propaganda I began to lose a sense of myself. They have been waging a psychological war on anyone that takes their bait. Believe me when I say, \u201cThey\u2019re propaganda engineering is at a professional operating level and the Underground Church operates both on the grid and off of it \u2013 the illusion they establish is that they are always off the grid.\u201d Making positive ID\u2019s in the Underground Church (UC) is highly difficult as upon their \u201cbaptism\u201d they are given new names and their old \u201clegal\u201d names are no longer of any import.

To clarify what kind of cult we&#039;re talking here, no, there were no human sacrifices, no one drank any cool aid, and no one ever got killed.  There was a lot of sex, a lot of good feelings, and only the occasional beating and child abduction.  By the time things fell apart, we had a commune the size of a small town, with almost five hundred people living across a few densely populated farms and homesteads, with a metric fuckton of farm land around it.  Just a heads up, I was a horny bisexual teenager given more or less free reign over hundreds of people, so this story has lots of messed up shit, including incest, some pedophilia and ephebophilia, lots of manipulation, and the occasional bit of violence, so if that&#039;s not your jam, peace. For the most part things were sunshine and rainbows, but towards the end when the law started getting involved, I was in a pretty bad place.

There are a lot of things to go over here, so I&#039;ve kind of broken this up into different sections of mixed text/greentext talking about how things started, how we actually did some of the more nefarious/deviant stuff, and of course, plenty of sex stories sprinkled in here and there for the more masturbatorially inclined among you.", "threadId": "700438996"}, {"teaser": "more like this?", "threadId": "700439054"}, {"teaser": "Quick!

Requires 10 resources and 5 wealth to choose this option) B: Improve Defenses (There is a linear improvement scale. Requires 10 resources and 5 wealth to choose this option) C: Improve Armor D: Improve Weaponry E: Improve Technology (Specify Domestic or War) F: Forage (25-100 food will be gathered) G: Explore (N, S, E, W) (New areas will be discovered, holding enemies, allies, great forests, caverns, etc. Adventure is out there!) H: Improve Tools (Increases slaves&#039; productivity) B1: Train soldiers: (Specify unit type and number) Random events will occur ever 2 turns, based on a random number generator. The number given will correspond to an event. Some numbers mean no event, some are a nice help, some start side-quests, some turn the world up-side-down, you get the idea. Battles take place from time to time, using a turn-based combat system. Each unit has ATK/DEF stats, which can be improved via the C, D, and E options. Be warned: our tribe is capable of being slaughtered, which ends the game. If trips are rolled, a very special event will occur (only once per number).", "threadId": "700471243"}, {"teaser": "pictureswap.org post your wins. . .SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT", "threadId": "700471283"}, {"teaser": "I never see these threads anymore.

You see, I had always wanted to be a part of the u.s. military. I wanted adventure in other words. Yet what I feel is that those who join themselves become a self glorified figure, expecting respect for every place which they walk. Meow my philosophy is, you earn my respect, you get my respect. Anyways, I got into an argument with a random other when I was younger. As soon as I proved a valid point, the first words that could fumble out of his mouth were, &quot;I AM A MILITARY COP&quot;. What was I supposed to say to that? That&#039;s when I began realize.. it seems that all th military is, is kids with guns who want to feel special and get respect without earning it. I feel this way because I constantly see it. People joining the navy as a reserve, the national guard as a reserve and coming home only to wear their BDU&#039;s for that one ego boosting phrase. &quot;Thank you for your service&quot; When in fact, all that they&#039;d done is stay on a ship and do what their told like a good dog. Not facing any danger nor real life-and-death circumstances. Here is another issue. They get every single thing handed to them.by uncle Sam. An education, a trade of knowledge and once more, to be looked at as a god of some sort. I can&#039;t go a day without seeing 18 year olds facebook littered with them dress in their camos in the most unrelated places. Waving a gun around and expecting people to bow to them, and these people do. Yet they can&#039;t seem to live in the real world, where an education is worked and strived for. Only one thing softens my heart towards this situation. The military is all that they have, so let them have it.

This also applies to the people who post in the feels threads(garbage) about how shitty their life is. You know what i&#039;m talking about.  &gt;be me &gt;age/virgin &gt;parents bad, bad event, etc. &gt;killing myself All of you who post shit like this deserve nothing but contempt.

You profess to have nothing to lose, yet you won&#039;t risk anything to change it?

Here&#039;s the thing; there is no reason you can&#039;t change your life and succeed. Unless you are literally chained to a chair with bars on your windows(but weirdly internet access) what&#039;s stopping you from leaving? If one day you decide to just walk out from your parents house and strike it out on your own, and apparently nobody is going to care, then how is that a worse option than suicide? Nobody has any faith in themselves anymore. Nobody thinks they can make it on their own merit. And it&#039;s so purely a lie. Leave your parents(or whatever&#039;s) house. Even if you have nowhere to go, have no plan, and no resources, at least you&#039;ve done something. Now if you fail, there&#039;s noone to blame but yourself.

Unfortunately, unlike on 4chan, the websites I frequent do not allow too many lines. This is why I propose an ending memearrow. It would look even better for multiline and is readable for single-line greentexts, plus a comment at the end may be added. It&#039;s up to the 4chan mods to make it so that the ending memearrow stops the greentext though. For example: &gt;be me, in high school&lt; (probably 2nd year I think) &gt;see cutie&lt; &gt;say hi&lt; &gt;she spits in my face&lt; &gt;I was kinda horny at that time and i have a spit fetish&lt; (dont judge) &gt;instantly cum&lt; &gt;she looks at me weird and goes away&lt; Now we could also write it on a single line without comments so that it&#039;s not messy: &gt;be me, in high school&lt;&gt;see cutie&lt;&gt;say hi&lt;&gt;she spits in my face&lt;&gt;I was kinda horny at that time and i have a spit fetish&lt;&gt;instantly cum&lt;&gt;she looks at me weird and goes away&lt; What do you guys think?
