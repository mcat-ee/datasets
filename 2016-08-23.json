Even if you are skeptical, please take a look at this page with an open mind. http://www.jesusisprecious.org/fundamentals/how_to_be_saved.htm  1. All have sinned and therefore cannot enter into Heaven on their own accord Isaiah 53:6, \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; Romans 3:23, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d  Romans 3:10, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d 2. There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3. Jesus lived a sinless life and shed his blood on the cross so we could be forgiven. John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "700639155"}, {"teaser": "show me ya one legged girls", "threadId": "700639569"}, {"teaser": "8-ball time /b/", "threadId": "700640353"}, {"teaser": "Is doing NoFap worth it?", "threadId": "700642979"}, {"teaser": "Take test, post results. &gt;Pic related my results", "threadId": "700643453"}, {"teaser": "SEXUAL GREEN TEXT STORIES: Post your best win here.

After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Christian friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i&#039;ve never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Christians and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn&#039;t get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven&#039;t been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands.

The second half gets a little better but not by much. There&#039;s a lot of repetition that is just stupid and scenes that make absolutely no sense and are totally unconnected with the story. It was poorly written af and the editing with the flashbacks was just jarring and unconnected with the plot as well. (At least what they called a plot anyway). As with Batman v. Superman, I imagine the extended cut will make more sense. I really enjoyed the Batman stuff, I think Affleck is great in the role and elevates the material. I like his Batman because he&#039;s an asshole but in a good way. Christian Bale is just an asshole. But I look forward to a BatFleck feature film. Also Harley Quinn&#039;s performance was great. And the visuals and characteristics of some of the characters I did find interesting, even though it was convoluted af. Not a big Will Smith fan but he was great too. I see what they were attempting to do with the Joker and it didn&#039;t bother me. He did come off a little cringy here and there but I didn&#039;t mind the crime boss stuff. Again, the material is fucked. Leto is a good actor but there&#039;s only so much you can do with shitty material. It&#039;s a different Joker, in a different Universe and I&#039;m ok with it. I did like the imagery of him surrounded by all his knives and how people were just terrified of him. I would have loved to see more of him in the movie and would be interested in seeing him again in another Batman feature, (opposite Affleck). It was just funky how they introduced him into the movie, one of the most iconic villains of all time. They should of had him try to foil the SQ&#039;s mission or watever. Idk It just should have been approached differently. tl;dr: it&#039;s a fucking mess, likely because the studio fucked with it too much, but some of the elements worked for me.", "threadId": "700661051"}, {"teaser": "Girlfriend sharing thread.

Women simply don&#039;t want shit-coloured penises; that&#039;s a fact. Who&#039;d want to suck on a piece of shit unless they had some sort of scat fetish? Face it, niggers, your futile attempts at cucking us is making you look desperate and in dire need of pussy. But you won&#039;t get any. Not a single woman, white or black, wants black dick unless they have a mental disorder. Everyone wants our creamy white dick. No, not want, they NEED our creamy white dick.

Because we know how to use it, and it doesn&#039;t look like something she just shat out 10 minutes prior.

There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3.

Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "700668245"}, {"teaser": "thread for the social tards &gt; be me @ 17 &gt; total social retard, no gfs - zero &gt; browses 4chan daily, meh not bad &gt; now @ 21 &gt; swoops girls left &amp; right &gt; comes back at 4chan just today &gt; tards left and right &gt; lol magnet:?xt=urn:btih:77738FE7BC22700F45BD116E155E02F215BB66D6&amp;dn=%5bPickUP%5d%20RSD%20Max%20-%20The%20Natural&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fbt2.t-ru.org%2fann%3fmagnet", "threadId": "700668266"}, {"teaser": "Pick a girl and tell us what you&#039;d do to her", "threadId": "700668297"}, {"teaser": "Just let my cat outside on its own for the first time.

Women simply don&#039;t want shit-coloured penises; that&#039;s a fact. Who&#039;d want to suck on a piece of shit unless they had some sort of scat fetish? Face it, niggers, your futile attempts at cucking us is making you look desperate and in dire need of pussy. But you won&#039;t get any. Not a single woman, white or black, wants black dick unless they have a mental disorder. Everyone wants our creamy white dick. No, not want, they NEED our creamy white dick. Even if your birth defected penises are an inch or two longer, most women will still prefer ours. Why? Because we know how to use it, and it doesn&#039;t look like something she just shat out 10 minutes prior. You niggers have attempted to reverse the roles given to you by society, but your rusty chains remain because you simply don&#039;t have enough intelligent thought to understand what kind of hornets nest you&#039;re prodding your shit-dicks into. That&#039;s the stuff you niggers have wet dreams over; imagining fucking your master&#039;s wives, sisters and mothers because it&#039;s what we&#039;ve done to you for so long. It&#039;s understandable really, you just want a little piece of the cake, but like a dog, you will remain on the floor and receive only tidbits we throw your way. And that&#039;s only if you&#039;re lucky. All two ounces of your nigger brain is fighting against what we&#039;re doing, but you can&#039;t stop us. We already won hundreds of years ago, and your women are thankful for us. We provide them with homes, infrastructure, water, electricity, and of course, our creamy, white cocks, which they love to suck on. Take a look at Africa; when we freed you niggers and let you be, your wasteland became worse; plagued with disease and drout; poorly built shanty houses made from shit and twigs. You can&#039;t even get a clean source of water. This is irrefutable evidence as to why you need us. But we don&#039;t need you. Bow down, niggers.

The second half gets a little better but not by much. There&#039;s a lot of repetition that is just stupid and scenes that make absolutely no sense and are totally unconnected with the story. It was poorly written af and the editing with the flashbacks was just jarring and unconnected with the plot as well. (At least what they called a plot anyway). As with Batman v. Superman, I imagine the extended cut will make more sense. I really enjoyed the Batman stuff, I think Affleck is great in the role and elevates the material. I like his Batman because he&#039;s an asshole but in a good way. Christian Bale is just an asshole. But I look forward to a BatFleck feature film. Also Harley Quinn&#039;s performance was great. And the visuals and characteristics of some of the characters I did find interesting, even though it was convoluted af. Not a big Will Smith fan but he was great too. I see what they were attempting to do with the Joker and it didn&#039;t bother me. He did come off a little cringy here and there but I didn&#039;t mind the crime boss stuff. Again, the material is fucked. Leto is a good actor but there&#039;s only so much you can do with shitty material. It&#039;s a different Joker, in a different Universe and I&#039;m ok with it. I did like the imagery of him surrounded by all his knives and how people were just terrified of him. I would have loved to see more of him in the movie and would be interested in seeing him again in another Batman feature, (opposite Affleck). It was just funky how they introduced him into the movie, one of the most iconic villains of all time. They should of had him try to foil the SQ&#039;s mission or watever. Idk It just should have been approached differently. tl;dr: it&#039;s a fucking mess, likely because the studio fucked with it too much, but some of the elements worked for me.", "threadId": "700676175"}, {"teaser": "Pick one I&#039;ll post nudes", "threadId": "700676182"}, {"teaser": "huge tits thread", "threadId": "700676183"}, {"teaser": "wtf is wrong with you guys , no loli thread ?", "threadId": "700676195"}, {"teaser": "Who is she?", "threadId": "700676223"}, {"teaser": "is your mother single? call me +44 7825619151\ufeff", "threadId": "700676302"}, {"teaser": "Post girls and a one way what porn they should do Reply for reply, I&#039;m looking at you newfags", "threadId": "700676324"}, {"teaser": "Okay /b/, here&#039;s a little fucked up story from high school. &gt;about two weeks into high school &gt;find out about this chick &gt;she was a 8.5/10, was pretty normal but she had no friends &gt;talk to her, she seems pretty cool &gt;a few days go by, we keep talking &gt;one day before going to class a friend stops me &gt;&quot;yo anon, why the fuck are you talking to her???&quot; &gt;what&#039;s wrong with that? &gt;&quot;she&#039;s a fucking psycho that attacks people, how have you not heard about this?&quot; &gt;it&#039;s too late now, she considers me my friend &gt;friend of a qt psychopath &gt;for some reason i&#039;m ok with this &gt;we chat and play vidya together, good times &gt;still no signs of her acting strangely &gt;then one day she asks me a question &gt;&quot;hey anon, do you think we could uh...go out on a date sometime?&quot; &gt;oh fuck &gt;this would&#039;ve been great if it wasn&#039;t for one thing &gt;i already had a girlfriend, attending my same class &gt;we knew each other since kindergarten &gt;i ain&#039;t dumping my girl for some other chick, i could never forgive myself &gt;tell her the truth &gt;she asks me who i&#039;m with &gt;i&#039;m sorry i won&#039;t tell you &gt;she pulls out a blade outta fucking nowhere &gt;panic.exe &gt;she forces me to tell her who my gf is &gt;i tell her &gt;she puts the blade away, i could feel the tip of a turd touching my underwear &gt;she acts all normal again &gt;she only says &quot;oh, ok&quot; &gt;what the fuck &gt;pretend it didn&#039;t happen &gt;fast forward to next day, time for PE &gt;my girl, me and the rest of the class are heading to the gym &gt;only one problem &gt;some fucking dumbass smoked pot in the gym &gt;police are there for whatever reason &gt;they say we can do our thing &gt;i&#039;m still thinking about this psycho bitch and how she almost cut my throat open &gt;suddenly hear screams from the hall &gt;it&#039;s her &gt;NONONONO &gt;she aims at my girl, jumping on her and pulling her hair &gt;everyone is panicking, i&#039;m freaking the fuck out &gt;cops try to get her away, they have no choice but to taze her &gt;she&#039;s shocked, lying on the ground, her body twitches like crazy &gt;she&#039;s a maniac &gt;maniac &gt;on the floor", "threadId": "700676429"}, {"teaser": "Wallpaper thread.", "threadId": "700676475"}, {"teaser": "Long time lurker, first time poster.

Make there be less ocean between islands, effectively making travel faster. This is bad because there would be a lot of potential for bugs, and they&#039;d have to test the majority of the map for them.  or  &gt;2: The easy way, just speed up links speed. You cover more distance faster, which makes travel time less, but the map stays the same size.  which made me realize, it&#039;s always easiest to affect the least amount of things. Instead of affecting the entire map, affect only link and his boat, minimizing the effected area.  Now I&#039;m not about to try and explain what God is, but what if the reason there is no evidence of the miracles and things he did in the bible is because rather than affecting the entire physical world around people, he kept his changes within the minds of the people.

I tried 3 different methods:  1. clixsense A shitty site where you do tasks, watch ads and do surveys. There is also a so called &quot;clixgrid&quot; which is basicly a lottery and a scam. Eventhough you pretty much sell yourself but once you get the hang of it (as soon as you know what the retards what to hear in the surveys) you can make a good amount of money in a short time. In 1h you make roughly 6$. They payout via paypal once a week so if you want your money you&#039;ll have to wait ~5days. You can use this link and you will get 5% of my income on top of yours and vice versa. http://csl.ink/27xj also pic related 2. Trading shit in steam  Basicly you just trade in your cards you get for playing and buy either more expensive shit to resale it or just safe it up. Does it pay off ? No. Is it easy ? Yes. Its also not that time consuming just put your shit into the market and wait. After ~ 2 months you&#039;ll get roughly 30cents which is enough to buy binding of isaac on the steam summer sale but thats pretty much it.  3. Selling botted accounts Literally just install a bot and sell accounts/items/gold in a mmo. Currently i&#039;m selling pokemon go accs which go for 10$/acc.

Yet, the average household income, adjusted for inflation, is virtually unchanged between then and now. Females have swamped the job market lowering wages and job availability for everyone! If females would just stay home, take care of the kids and cook dinner like good wives, their husbands would have more jobs, better jobs and be able to support the whole family! But no, feminists want to have jobs so now both the man and woman have to work, both make less, and you have to pay someone on average $12,000/year to take care of your kids to boot! Not to mention, how many kids are injured in day care? Raped? Killed? Day cares often have ratios of 12:1 kids per adult or worse. Can they really give your kid the one on one attention the mother could? Without a parent, how do you expect your kids to properly bond with you?

Yet, the average household income, adjusted for inflation, is virtually unchanged between then and now. Females have swamped the job market lowering wages and job availability for everyone! If females would just stay home, take care of the kids and cook dinner like good wives, their husbands would have more jobs, better jobs and be able to support the whole family! But no, feminists want to have jobs so now both the man and woman have to work, both make less, and you have to pay someone on average $12,000/year to take care of your kids to boot! Not to mention, how many kids are injured in day care? Raped? Killed? Day cares often have ratios of 12:1 kids per adult or worse. Can they really give your kid the one on one attention the mother could? Without a parent, how do you expect your kids to properly bond with you?

We had been talking about a foursome for a while, and my wife got super drunk and kinda spearheaded the whole thing, despite my discomfort and me telling her I didn&#039;t feel ready. I wanted to set a date, so that I could be a little bit more prepared beforehand, and therefore comfortable. Long story short, I was having performance anxiety and ended up giving a lot of oral while my other friend banged them both. I didn&#039;t end up cumming. Needless to say I feel really shitty about this, especially since he was able to make my wife squirt and I&#039;ve never been able to. I don&#039;t feel like I was prepared for this, and as a result my self-esteem has gone through the floor. I brought these concerns up to my wife and she said she was sorry, but she thought we would both enjoy it. I&#039;m currently in a pretty deep pit (despite her reassurances), and have been watching TV for about 2 days straight now. I&#039;m hurt because I couldn&#039;t preform, and because she went ahead with it anyways despite my fears. I feel like what we have has become less special. All I want is for her to give me a real apology, but she says she doesn&#039;t regret the night at all. She says I just need to get out and stop thinking about it, but I feel like she doesn&#039;t understand how much she hurt me.

And it&#039;s scary.  I made friends with one two semesters ago, not because I wanted to cherish the ideology or anything, but because I wanted to understand, seek and get some empathy, I had never met one before in my life, and right then I had, for the first time. Long story short, feel free to ask questions, but I ended up becoming close with her. And you have to understand, I don&#039;t agree with anything she says. Her opinions are the typical bullshit. Her facebook page is filled with nothing but extremist liberal buttfuck propaganda, but we managed to bond, we managed to be friends, briefly. You see, she&#039;s gay, obviously. Told me she&#039;s desperate for a girl, so I set her up with one- and as a result it became the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. I just set up two equally as shitty extremist feminists with each other, and from there is where the problems start. Now, I was far from in love with her, trust me. Deep down I knew she was a hypocrite about her sexuality because she gave me a blowjob in the past (and she wasn&#039;t too bad at it.) so I always, and especially, took her opinions with a grain of salt. But after we stopped talking she made friends with this other girl, whom I hit on once, but it didn&#039;t go anywhere. Last semester, that girl I just mentioned has been screaming at me in public that I sexually harass women and shit. The other girl is still with the girl I set her up with, and she hangs out frequently with the screecher. I can only assume the worst. I&#039;m worried that this would go to the police.

Yet, the average household income, adjusted for inflation, is virtually unchanged between then and now. Females have swamped the job market lowering wages and job availability for everyone! If females would just stay home, take care of the kids and cook dinner like good wives, their husbands would have more jobs, better jobs and be able to support the whole family! But no, feminists want to have jobs so now both the man and woman have to work, both make less, and you have to pay someone on average $12,000/year to take care of your kids to boot! Not to mention, how many kids are injured in day care? Raped? Killed? Day cares often have ratios of 12:1 kids per adult or worse. Can they really give your kid the one on one attention the mother could? Without a parent, how do you expect your kids to properly bond with you?

For example, this weekend i was at a bar called Coyote Ugly Saloon in Nashville, TN (you may have seen the movie, this is similar). At said bar, for 20 dollars you can get what they call a &quot;body shot&quot; from a bartender. They climb up on the bar and tell you &quot;im going to do whatever i want to you&quot; (of course i couldnt give them my money fast enough), they cut the waistband off your underwear and tie it around your wrists,put your hands behind your head, pull off your shirt and write on your chest something like &quot;im a dirty slut&quot; or things like that and push your head down to take a shot glass into your mouth off their belly and squeeze a lime into your mouth.

All have sinned and therefore cannot enter into Heaven on their own accord Isaiah 53:6, \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; Romans 3:23, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d  Romans 3:10, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d 2. There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3. Jesus lived a sinless life and shed his blood on the cross so we could be forgiven. John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.", "threadId": "700740905"}, {"teaser": "Prove your an oldfag pic unrelated", "threadId": "700740928"}, {"teaser": "Quick b what is this?", "threadId": "700740950"}, {"teaser": "twitch tv /assortedcolors plz watch my stream", "threadId": "700740967"}, {"teaser": "panties thread", "threadId": "700741042"}, {"teaser": "Boyfriend is too busy with college and girls in his dorm hall to notice me anymore, any suggestions on what to do?", "threadId": "700741047"}, {"teaser": "Cheating story....

The second half gets a little better but not by much. There&#039;s a lot of repetition that is just stupid and scenes that make absolutely no sense and are totally unconnected with the story. It was poorly written af and the editing with the flashbacks was just jarring and unconnected with the plot as well. (At least what they called a plot anyway). As with Batman v. Superman, I imagine the extended cut will make more sense. I really enjoyed the Batman stuff, I think Affleck is great in the role and elevates the material. I like his Batman because he&#039;s an asshole but in a good way. Christian Bale is just an asshole. But I look forward to a BatFleck feature film. Also Harley Quinn&#039;s performance was great. And the visuals and characteristics of some of the characters I did find interesting, even though it was convoluted af. Not a big Will Smith fan but he was great too. I see what they were attempting to do with the Joker and it didn&#039;t bother me. He did come off a little cringy here and there but I didn&#039;t mind the crime boss stuff. Again, the material is fucked. Leto is a good actor but there&#039;s only so much you can do with shitty material. It&#039;s a different Joker, in a different Universe and I&#039;m ok with it. I did like the imagery of him surrounded by all his knives and how people were just terrified of him. I would have loved to see more of him in the movie and would be interested in seeing him again in another Batman feature, (opposite Affleck). It was just funky how they introduced him into the movie, one of the most iconic villains of all time. They should of had him try to foil the SQ&#039;s mission or watever. Idk It just should have been approached differently. tl;dr: it&#039;s a fucking mess, likely because the studio fucked with it too much, but some of the elements worked for me.", "threadId": "700743312"}, {"teaser": "It&#039;s time for /b/ingo!

Maybe you don&#039;t realize it, but things like this is done as a means to try and gain power (however trivial and temporary) over other humans. The less intellectual will try to play this off as &quot;so little&quot; or &quot;just a joke&quot; - but those of us - the see-ers of the universe, can view it for what it really is.. and you can try to to play it off as something &quot;little&quot; or &quot;innocent&quot;, or you can actually take responsibility for what it actually is - evil.

I&#039;ve been friends with this girl for a year now, and the past couple of months i&#039;ve been trying to get intimate. This is how it has progressed. I showed her a dickpic about 4 months ago, and that&#039;s when all of this started. Fast forward 5-10 days, I managed to get her to send me titpics and asspics on snapchat, something that she said she would NEVER EVER do. Nowadays I almost always get a titpic when I ask for it, aslong as she&#039;s in an appropriate place to take a pic. When we see eachother we&#039;ve started to get very physical, cuddling and she lets me touch her tits whenever I want, same with ass. We&#039;ve made out one time in the past, and I liked it quite a bit, so I decided to go for it and ask her, first she was hesitant, but after a couple of minutes we started making out, this was 2 days ago. We made out three times that day, and yesterday we made out once . Thing is, she&#039;s SOOOO hard to read, she gives out mixed signals sometimes, sometimes she wants to cuddle, wants me to touch her etc, sometimes she doesn&#039;t. What to do? I REALLY like this girl and I&#039;m pretty sure she likes me quite alot too.", "threadId": "700743850"}, {"teaser": "daily requesting sauce for this video", "threadId": "700743869"}, {"teaser": "Hunger Games Sim Thread Pocket Fast Edition Post 24 nigs to kill eachother Rules: No exact samefaggin&#039;", "threadId": "700743887"}, {"teaser": "My wife is better than yours, sorry", "threadId": "700743891"}, {"teaser": "Waifu claiming thread.

I showed her a dickpic about 4 months ago, and that&#039;s when all of this started. Fast forward 5-10 days, I managed to get her to send me titpics and asspics on snapchat, something that she said she would NEVER EVER do. Nowadays I almost always get a titpic when I ask for it, aslong as she&#039;s in an appropriate place to take a pic. When we see eachother we&#039;ve started to get very physical, cuddling and she lets me touch her tits whenever I want, same with ass. We&#039;ve made out one time in the past, and I liked it quite a bit, so I decided to go for it and ask her, first she was hesitant, but after a couple of minutes we started making out, this was 2 days ago. We made out three times that day, and yesterday we made out once . Thing is, she&#039;s SOOOO hard to read, she gives out mixed signals sometimes, sometimes she wants to cuddle, wants me to touch her etc, sometimes she doesn&#039;t. What to do?

It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can&#039;t-Be-Flushed threshold. I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. &quot;Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don&#039;t I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!&quot; I said to myself.

Two nights ago i woke up on my couch and saw man standing behind the couch parallel to where i was. not moving but standing. I have a big picture window and it was 6 am so the sunlight made it a silouette. The couch i was laying on is a L couch so the two couches put together make a giant hard [ or C. on the other side of the couch was my girlfriend but dead or half dead. I could see the blood settled in her body but she said something and i dont know what. I could not move and nothing happened to me and he just stood there. It felt like i could flex my muscles but i was being held down. (hold your arm down and pull up, same feeling). Randomly it went back to normal and i could move again. This seemed so real because everything in the room was the same as when i could move again. (like water bottles in same place etc). Lately I always feel watched now. This could be me tricking myself. Another incident was tonight. I was in the garage working on my engine when I heard my girlfriend walking on the driveway and into the backyard. Our backyard is all stone garden so its easy to hear and distinct noise. I went inside later and asked why she came out and she said she never came out nor let even the dog out. The night before this all happen I was working on my car with my friend and we heard someone on the trail behind my yard yell &quot;HELP&quot; . My backyard has a trail instead of alley. We went back to see but heard nothing. as we turned around to leave I heard another sound like a groan or &quot;ooooo&quot; but it cut off suddenly. I called the cops but they didnt find a thing and the trail is blocked off on both ends. That was the first night of things. The dream then happened that night and tonight the walking.

Then I turned to my dad and asked him how many people were there. He said since the stadium was full, it was like 50,000. On my way home, I saw tons of people walking towards the station like a massive current as well and that made me surprised again. When I got home, because I already learned the Japan&#039;s population was like 100 million in social study, I divided it by 50,000 using my calculator. The answer was 2,000. I was at a loss completely. The crowd in the stadium that looked like very large was just a fraction of the entire population. After that, I noticed it. Until then, I thought I was kinda a special person, it was fun to be with my family, and I had fun with my classmates too. I believed people and things around me were literally special and I was as well. But it wasn&#039;t true. Those kind of things were really ordinary and happened all over the places in Japan. Waking up, brushing my teeth, going to school, and going to sleep, there was nothing special about my life. I felt like everything I thought was cool and interesting faded away to a gray void.

The man always had something in his hand, I could never remember what it was whole I was dreaming, but when I woke up I realized it was a kitchen knife every time. Now in the dream, the man somehow moved 2 meters from my door to my bed in under a second. It never seemed strange or out of place though, it never seemed he was traveling faster than he should have. Now he would pin me down and bring the knife to my neck. I always woke up before the knife got to my neck. The knife never touched my neck, I always woke up before then.

Approximately 40% of all manmade CO2 is successfully absorbed by the environment. This means roughly 60% of manmade CO2 is not absorbed and thus increases atmospheric CO2. We may therefore say we need to reduce global CO2 production by around 60% to reach a break even point - but this ignores the fact that absorption rises along with our production. Still, something around this number can be found in the scientific research. &quot;In order to stabilize CO2 concentrations at about 450 ppm by 2050, global emissions would have to decline by about 60%. Industrialized countries greenhouse gas emissions would have to decline by about 80%.&quot; -Barack Obama&#039;s Presidential Climate Action Plan 80% - And all our proposed plans (if fully executed) would reduce emissions by less than 5%. The United States accounts for about 17% of manmade CO2. Japan, 4%. Korea, 2%. European nations between 1 and 2 percent each. China and the developing world account for over 47% of manmade CO2. So if you wiped out all of the US, all of Europe, Japan, and Korea, and then managed to reduce China by around 25%, you would be near the break even point for CO2 absorption. Perhaps you start to see now what we are actually facing here. A 60% global reduction in CO2 cannot be accomplished without creating a worldwide economic depression which would no doubt kill millions of human beings.

On this trip I will be seeing all the beauty and wonder this world has to offer. I will also have amazing sex with many women of almost all nationalities, all turned on my looks, charm, and wealth. After I return from that trip my parents will be buying me two houses, in locations of my choosing. You are angry because you are not rich, and never will be. In the future you will have to kiss ass to someone like me, just so I toss you enough cash to keep you housed and fed. Maybe you already do this. You will probably never travel the world, and even if you do it will be on tacky two week package trips. You will always own second hand cars, and will have to either rent or take a mortgage to have housing. You will likely never find an attractive loyal white wife, as no woman wants to be with a poor fag in this age of rampant materialism. Hell, you are probably so much of a and insecure bum that you don&#039;t even get laid here in your 20&#039;s. The sad thing is that no amount of whining on the internet, or faggy little rent-a-crowd protests will change anything. I, and people of my class, will live a nice life. And you, will live a bleak life characterized by desperation and servitude. In fact it is only getting better for people like me, all of the immigration and outsourcing means you can minimize wage expenses hugely these days, the simplest way to improve bankable profits.", "threadId": "700777678"}, {"teaser": "Get in here faggots https://togethertube.com/rooms/f2c1c70a-36aa-4196-84c1-c4406a1aaf62", "threadId": "700777718"}, {"teaser": "GLORIOUS", "threadId": "700777771"}, {"teaser": "which&#039;s your wife?

[Optional Reading] Since about the fourth or fifth grade I&#039;ve been asking myself why I am alive. I have eventually decided that I am alive because my mother specifically wanted me to be alive as an act of rebellion against her parents. In recent years, especially since my 20th birthday this August, I&#039;ve been wondering why I stay alive. The best answer I can muster is that I am alive to find some form of love in my life, and since I derive none from my family and little from most of my friends, I am specifically alive to find love in a romantic interest via a third party of some description(this excludes my cat, which despite her meowing at me for breakfast at four in the morning and stepping on my keyboard in the middle of games, is my REAL only reason to live). That being said, since I live to find some form of love, I have come to realise that I only love for the sake of living, and beyond this, as I have discussed with my therapist, I&#039;m little more than an unmotivated sociopath that wants to watch the world burn.

I need your help and advice! Germanfag here! Please read and guide me. I know half of the advices will be shit, but I&#039;ll try it anyway.

I love her and she is cute, caring, we bought a house together, got a dog, cats etc.etc. Sex is okay. Sometimes boring like she only jerks me off and sometimes better (like last time when I got home from work and she sat there in lingerie, ran my favorite porn-DVD and let me fuck her ass). Standard middle class relationship. And now, Sweet Jesus, there comes this woman into my life (she&#039;s a customer of me, I&#039;m self-employed). We got a meeting in the evenig, a few weeks ago, talked about her order and so on. I got this principle never to get close / private with customers and I fucking broke my own rule: We drank a few beer and started talking intimate and about private stuff. Nothing too serious. We didn&#039;t kiss and we didn&#039;t fuck, or touch, or anything. She is so thrilling! With all her tattoos, Piercings, dyed hair and so on. And except from that she&#039;s is like a beardless, titted version of myself. Like a lost twin. Almost scarry. She and my GF are pretty similar what&#039;s about their characteristics. So nothing too special there. Long story short: I fell so hard in love like I didn&#039;t for over 10 years! Dammit. I can&#039;t eat, I&#039;m just drinking black coffee and beer and smoking cigs over the day, I&#039;m dreaming of her almost every night, my thoughts go round and round about her all day. I can&#039;t even concentrate a my work. Every time my phone rings I hope it&#039;s her and when she won&#039;t text me or call I&#039;m feel this pressure on my chest and my throat is tightening. My hands are even sweaty while I&#039;m writing this. It&#039;s not even like I just wanna fuck her or so. I just want to be near her and hold and cuddle her and enjoy her presence.

I never had many friends, besides a small period of time ( age 13-16 ) where I got In with some troubled rich kids. I managed to lose them after fucking a few of an ex gfs friends. But besides that I&#039;ve always been alone. I know what it feels like to be so isolated you lose a part of your mind that connects you to society and other people. I now have little empathy nor sympathy. I caught a break coming out of my isolated slump by turning over a lot of stocks for large profit ( being nineteen and middle class ). Now I work at an investment firm and don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening to me. Every day I go to work and bet against societies best interest. I look for what industry Is collapsing slowly to invest In like a vulture. All the women that I meet are glorified prostitutes that want an apartment and fun money , I guess that&#039;s the life I was signing up for. How do I get myself back? This &quot;culture&quot; I live In turns men Into greedy sociopaths, and I&#039;m slowly becoming one of them. But knowing everyone you meet has a secret modus operandi that usually involves screwing you you can&#039;t really be a nice person. I&#039;ve spent nights awake trying to determine the sincerity of certain individuals. My morning routine Is nearly robotic now. I wake up at five, put on my depressing music, treadmill, weights, jerk off, shower, check on my elderly neighbor, get her groceries if needed, then go to work at 8:30. My work day Is even more mentally Ill. Pace back and forth looking at tickers, get ignored by most people ( I was brought In at five year paygrade, this upset most of my coworkers ), meetings, cigarettes, then leave.

Absorgender- A gender that is what the genders of those around you are. As you are around more people, even if some leave, they continue to add to the genders you feel. You stay the genders that you have taken in until you hit a max of some sort. At that point you become like a blank slate, being only one gender (it doesn\u2019t have to be agender or neutral, it can be any gender and the base gender can be different each time). If you absorb one gender more easily than other genders, you can replace gender in the term with the gender you absorb best. Like absorgirl, absornonbinary, absordemiboy, etc. Adamasgender- A gender which refuses to be categorized. Adeptogender- When your state of gender was obtained through your realization of your kinself. as in, your kin realization spurred your gender realization. (note: the gender and kin type do not necessarily have to correlate with each other) Aerogender- See evaisgender. Aesthetgender- A gender derived from an aesthetic, also known as videgender. Aethergender- A gender that feels very wide, commanding, breathtaking and powerful. Affectugender- A gender affected by mood swings. Agender- Having no gender or a lack of gender identity Agenderfluid- See cancegender. Agenderflux- See librafluid. Alexigender- Gender identity which is fluid between more than one gender, but the individual cannot tell what those genders are. Aliusgender- A gender which is removed from common gender descriptors and guidelines. Ambigender- A feeling of two genders simultaneously, without fluidity/shifting. May be used synonymously, in some cases, with bigender. Amaregender- A gender that changes depending on who you\u2019re in love with.
