Women simply don&#039;t want shit-colored penises; that&#039;s a fact. Who&#039;d want to suck on a piece of shit unless they had some sort of scat fetish? Face it, niggers, your futile attempts at cucking us is making you look desperate and in dire need of pussy. But you won&#039;t get any. Not a single woman, white or black, wants black dick unless they have a mental disorder. Everyone wants our creamy white dick. No, not want, they NEED our creamy white dick. Even if your birth defected penises are an inch or two longer, most women will still prefer ours. Why? Because we know how to use it, and it doesn&#039;t look like something she just shat out 10 minutes prior. You niggers have attempted to reverse the roles given to you by society, but your rusty chains remain because you simply don&#039;t have enough intelligent thought to understand what kind of hornets nest you&#039;re prodding your shit-dicks into. That&#039;s the stuff you niggers have wet dreams over; imagining fucking your master&#039;s wives, sisters and mothers because it&#039;s what we&#039;ve done to you for so long.

And that&#039;s only if you&#039;re lucky. All two ounces of your nigger brain is fighting against what we&#039;re doing, but you can&#039;t stop us. We already won hundreds of years ago, and your women are thankful for us. We provide them with homes, infrastructure, water, electricity, and of course, our creamy, white cocks, which they love to suck on. Take a look at Africa; when we freed you niggers and let you be, your wasteland became worse; plagued with disease and drout; poorly built shanty houses made from shit and twigs. You can&#039;t even get a clean source of water. This is irrefutable evidence as to why you need us. But we don&#039;t need you. Bow down, niggers.

Let me take a step back here: When I was ~19 years old my parents kicked me out. I was never a tidy person, I didn&#039;t clean up after me, which made my parents pretty angry. In particular left some leftovers in my room, and didn&#039;t notice that maggots had gathered there. My mother noticed though, and snapped. I was kicked out on short notice. Now, this was during civilian service, so I asked my workplace to give me a place to stay as they were required to. Everything was fine, as I cleaned the apartment when I moved out, so no trouble there. But then I moved and started attending university, paying rent for my new apartment by working part time. Thing is, I didn&#039;t clean this apartment, and I left leftovers staying around. Fruit-flies everywhere. I managed to get rid of them - or so I thought. I didn&#039;t really cook a lot, mostly eating snacks, so it took me a while to notice that my fridge had stopped working. When I looked inside, there were maggots everywhere. The stench was so overwhelming that I immediately shut the fridge door and decided to ignore the problem. My theory on why the fridge broke is that the fruit flies got in there and managed to plug something vital - or maybe they found a good environment after the fridge broke for some other reason, who knows.

Now that you know which time-period I am refering to I&#039;m going to explain my thesis; Some of the artists and celebrities that was active during the racial segregation stood up for human and civil rights through their works while others did not. I would like to argue that those who did not fight for equal rights should be considered racist. That means that black lives matter activists like Zarna Joshi should, and have the right to publicly shame all still alive public figures that did not stand up for human and civil rights during the 1950-60s.  Is this opinion weird or am I on to something here? Maybe you find this obvious while I have not yet realized to which extent racism acctually plagued the United States until late 60s?

To select what circle your demon is from, roll a d10, with 10 allowing you to choose the circle considering there are only nine, ill throw each of the nine into a random number generator and run rolls by that To determine whether it is lesser or greater, roll three d20s, 10 and below means a lesser, 11 and higher means greater, im not adding up the points, but its a best of three Powers i will leave up to the player, but i have final say. That means if i feel it is too over powered or doesnt fit the demon&#039;s circle, ill ask oyu to come up with something a bit more fitting Your starting human weapon is a bit different. Depending on your circle, I may make exceptions to your weapon, but the primary rules are that it has to be able to fit in a lunch box, and be available to normal people.

I&#039;ve divided it in 2 parts: How to look, and how to act. Look. &gt;1. Its time to lose weight, anon. Fat ain&#039;t good. Just cut on sweets and snacks. Drink water or eat a fruit every time you want a snack, it does wonders. However, girls like big guys, so you can be strong and fat (A.K.A russian dads), that&#039;s ok. Just hit the gym, if that&#039;s the case. &gt;2. Get a haircut. If you have long hair, just cut it. It&#039;s ugly. Every guy looks better with short hair. &gt;3. Beard. If you can grow it, groom it. If you can grow just a bit, make sure it doesn&#039;t look like pubes. If all else fails, give it up. Better no beard than some lousy hairs. &gt;4. Start dressing nicer. It&#039;s a pain, but just get a good shirt and a pair of jeans. &gt;5. Gym. like i said, it&#039;s optional. But you should get some muscles. Gives you better odds. &gt;6. Hygiene. Don&#039;t overdo it, but brush your teeth, put deodorant, and shower regularly. I don&#039;t even know why i have to say this. Also, Don&#039;t smell like asshole, cause that&#039;s what your mouth will smell like if you don&#039;t brush. Act. &gt;1. Job. The older you are, the better job you need to make yourself look good. Women want someone who has his shit together. &gt;2. Get a reasonable hobby. Play an instrument, go running, do what ever a normal person does. 4chan is not a hobby. &gt;3. Stop doing stuff that affect you negatively. Are you watching to much anime? MLP? Too much gore threads? Jacking off a lot? Cut that shit, at least in half. (If your&#039;e watching My little pony, just.. don&#039;t.) Even if your&#039;e not noticing it, it&#039;s affecting you for the worst.  &gt;4. Control yourself. That&#039;s what an adult does. No woman wants to date a child. No immature jokes or comments, Don&#039;t do stupid shit, and so on. &gt;5. start going out, either with friends (who might look like you do right now, which gives you an advantage), or on your own. Just go to a bar and order a drink, which leads me to my final point.

First, I will go with the massive redpill, losing time will not lead me and you anywhere : today, in the USA, and in Europe, there are far more employed people there were during 50&#039;s or 60&#039;s. I&#039;ll take France as exemple, because I know very well the stats about this country. The unemployment stats began in 1966, and the period 1945-1975 is the \u00ab muh full employment \u00bb meme. It is the same in USA, it is the same in Germany (it is slightly different because the Berlinmauer fall in 1990 ), the same in UK etc... The main difference is that, when leftists and conservatives are talking about full employment during 60&#039;s, they are talking about men full employment. Proportion of carrier-women or women-workers was very low, most of them were housewives. Today (in France), employment rate is around 80%. It means 20% of people are jobless. While in 1965, there were 50% jobless people : the women. You must understand allowing women work is a way to push-down the wages and the right of workers. Seriously, with all the women you know, how many are syndicalists ? How many would be ready to stop working for 10 days to struggle against a mass lays-off ? Exactly, zero. In France, for instance, every sector infested by women immediately become a decaying sector : teachers, nurses etc... And it destroy them, because they have to fight against their maternal instinct, they want children, but they do not want to stop working because of the \u00ab muh free-independent woman \u00bb meme, but they realize they are wasting their time, so they go in depression, want to have children and the loop is on. Unlike conservacucks think, full employment is possible : if (not all) 75, 80% women become housewives, then 96% men will have some well paid jobs and it would make you country great again.", "threadId": "702422048"}, {"teaser": "Looking for Yoonie Bae Patron sets if anyone is so kind to post some, I have a couple of them already.", "threadId": "702422055"}, {"teaser": "What do you think about New York City?", "threadId": "702422081"}, {"teaser": "Could you rate my girlfriend please?", "threadId": "702422211"}, {"teaser": "ITT hottest milfs of all time  Ava addams", "threadId": "702422230"}, {"teaser": "tbh fam I can&#039;t handle life anymore.

Gambling: I\u2019d always thought my 7/10 girlfriend\u2019s biggest flaw was her gambling problem. Worst example; the week before we moved in (i.e. deposit paid) she got drunk and gambled away the last \u00a32k of her savings. Smoking: I knew she was a smoker, but I didn&#039;t know she was a heavy smoker, 15-20 cigs a day. Drinking: She wouldn&#039;t drink whole bottles when we were together, even for whole weekends and week-long holidays, she hid her heavy drinking. Employment: She has an office job and her drinking doesn\u2019t affect her work yet, as she currently only drinks at night.  Education: Not a Feminazi or (total) Libtard despite studying English Literature, Religious studies, Film studies &amp; Women\u2019s studies in College.  Trauma: Her ex-fianc\u00e9e drank a lot and encouraged her too, they had a surprise pregnancy, 6 months in she had a miscarriage, the coward emptied the apartment of his stuff and bailed while she was recovering in hospital, he never returned her calls. &gt;I love her for all the reasons that aren&#039;t listed above.

When he found out, the business fell apart. I have not talked to any of my family in 7 months and I am in a huge amount of debt I cannot repay. I have already had multiple notices that they are going to come and repo all the shit I have left in my one room shack.

Once, when I was just a teenager, I was alone with her in her house, and I managed to put my hand on her leg and go slightly up until nearly her sex, she let me do it. Then I stopped because I was too young and stupid, but still she let me. Most recently she had an accident in which she nearly died. Last time I saw her, it was kind of hot between us, I went sit next to her to talk to her and she was tooking my arm and sometimes putting her head on my shoulder, etc. When I left, I couldn&#039;t resist a little caress as I left my hand slide up against her interior tight. She didn&#039;t say shit and was clearly trying to hide it. One other time, we had a big dinner with lots of poeple, and at the end when we were saying goodbye, she rushed to me in a way no one was behind her and my body hided her from the poeple behind me. She seemed to want something. I should have kissed her on the mouth. I think maybe her accident has her thinking to enjoy life as much as she can before it&#039;s too late... She is single, but I&#039;m with someone and it&#039;s a real good relationship. The worst would be the son of that aunt, who would want to kill me if I banged her mother and it was discovered.

I say that because even at my lowest, I had faith that things would get better or I would MAKE them better. Through incredible mortification, shame, guilt, dejection, disgust, whatever--I was able to grit my teeth, force my head back up high, and uncurl my shoulders. I&#039;ve never really had to suffer physically; the worst I can say is that I&#039;ve broken both elbows, and my left wrist, drowned, had my esophagus ripped up by a hastily removed breathing tube, and a handful of nasty fevers and ear infections...which were all quickly and efficiently treated. I&#039;ve had to work a handful of jobs that I truly, absolutely hated, but they weren&#039;t bad FOR me and nobody&#039;s ever needed to depend on me. Where I&#039;m going with all of this: I don&#039;t think immortality would be a curse. I&#039;m already pretty likely to outlive everyone I care about, I don&#039;t intend to have children, I get nothing emotionally out of relationships, I tend to find solitude more fulfilling than surrounding myself with people (even if I LIKE those people), I&#039;m not afraid of work, and the quality of human life (in 1st world civilizations) seems to be improving every other day or so with some new technological breakthrough. So if I had the option to stop aging--or even to stop aging in my late forties--I&#039;d want to live for at least another two to three hundred years. I&#039;m confident that I could continue to come up with reasons to keep living even if everything went to shit and I became the last person living in a ruined wasteland. So long as fragments of our civilization remained, I&#039;d have things to consume and produce for my own enjoyment. Do any of you want to live forever?

Does this weird burning sensation go away after a few sessions or do I just have to learn to work with it?

Well long story short I broke into the place and went directly over to the crib where I saw the baby sleeping like an angel. I pick it up and placed the baby&#039;s anus securely around my cock as I began to work my way up to maximum thrust. just then I noticed their youngest son was watching me.. I got so scared, so I slipped the baby of my penis and went out thru the window the same way I came in. But before I left I told his brother if he told anyone that I would be back, then I should him my blood covered cock to let him know I was serious. When I got back to my house I seen my neighbor&#039;s house light up like it was the fucking circus. I could see my neighbor running back and forth between the baby&#039;s room and his youngest son room. I just stood there on my front lawn watching as my neighbor&#039;s tried to figure out what was going on as they called the police.

There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3.

From the beginning all I really wanted to do was to just get my dick wet and just laugh it off but now I&#039;m getting attached. We&#039;ve been talking for the past two days about literally nothing but sex, and she&#039;s opened up about how she wants me to fuck her raw and cum inside her.
