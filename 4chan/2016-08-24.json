These low-IQ women are less intelligent and more primal than high IQ women. They rely more on their instinctual brain for decisions rather than their intellectual brain. Thus, they are attracted to more primal traits, such as physical superiority and massive cocks. What these stupid niggers and white girls don\u2019t understand is that there is an entire class of human beings above them. Ones that rely on their intellect to govern their decisions. These are the rulers of the plantation. No high-IQ white man would blow his money at the club, or blow it buying lambos unless it was chump change at that point. What smart white men do is use their money to make more money. They spend 100k investing, buying property, etc. They become a TRULY superior class by becoming the billionaire elite who have real power and influence in this world, both monetarily and politically. Families like the Rockefellers and Rothschilds have truly secured their genetic line. Black rappers who think they are rich are just low-IQ niggers who think blowing their money is an intelligent thing to do, because their little primal brains can\u2019t comprehend what true power is, and they get caught up in the illusion that they have it.  Jay-Z is one of the only niggers who is truly making an effort to secure his genetic line and family. Let these stupid ass white girls breed with theses niggers, I\u2019ll take the chick who hangs out at the political fundraiser and venture capital dinners, the girl who hangs around high class NYC clubs and hotels, because she\u2019s smart enough to be attracted to the superior race.", "threadId": "700809030"}, {"teaser": "My friend just fucking bought me a salmon colored fedora.

I\u2019m fucking crying because of how stupid I am. Okay, so my girlfriend was supposed to come over to my house today because I was going to go take her to a movie.

Instead of doing the right thing by comforting her, I half-focus on my game and her. She starts telling me her cat died, and just as she was getting into it, I get into a random encounter in my game. A shiny pidgey. Holy shit. (For those of you who don\u2019t know/care, shiny Pokemon have less than a 1/1,000 chance of appearing; 1/8192 to be exact.). I stare into my screen in amazement, yelling \u201choly shit, YES\u201d, interrupting her mid-story. She sobs more, and she starts to yell \u201cYou don\u2019t even fucking care! YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY YOUR FUCKING GAME!\u201d I\u2019m still looking at my screen, still focusing on catching my shiny Pidgey, when she walks over, and tosses the game against the wall. I run over and pick up my DS hoping that nothing has changed on screen, and quickly noticed that she broke it. My system and my shiny Pidgey, gone forever. I start screaming every obscenity I know, and started flailing my arms around. I didn\u2019t know she was behind me, and apparently I backhanded her in the face while I was being a dumbass and swinging my fists around. She yells out \u201cFUCK YOU\u201d, and runs out of my house in tears. What have I done? I\u2019ve fucked up so badly, and I need to know how to approach her.

There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3.

Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "700877203"}, {"teaser": "Hey /b/  Need some help finding a song from Dream Theater.

Here is a list a things that could happen to you if you drive drunk like me. -If you own the car they will try to take your car away from you, I totaled the car so this didn&#039;t apply to me. -Went to court so many times I lost count, probably over 20 times most of which took place two years after my arrest, not good if you have job. -Lawyers cost up to $5000 or more. -Fine set by court $1200 -DMV Fine $750 -Lost my right to drive except to work, doctor, and school while my case was still pending, after sentencing I got my license officially revoked from DMV for a mandatory 12 months for being underage at the time of my arrest, I can still drive to work. -Ignition Interlock 6-12 months costs $100 a month and you need to get it serviced once a month at inconvenient times. -I got sentenced to probation for 3 years, this is probably a result of me being in an accident and underage. Must visit officer once a month. $300 fee plus $30 a month plus $12.50 for a drug test -Pointless alcohol class once a week for 6 weeks $200 -MADD Victim Impact Panel $100 -Liability Car Insurance costs Quadrupled when I was sentenced and will still be higher for the next few years. So this event cost me a minimum of $10,000 but much more when factoring future insurance costs and all the time off from past work. On top of all this I have a criminal record.

There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3. Jesus lived a sinless life and shed his blood on the cross so we could be forgiven. John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "700903691"}, {"teaser": "Post a more cringe TV series than this.

The condition (selective mutism) which has been plaguing me my whole life will finally be put to death, to burn in the deepest circles of hell where it belongs.

I just wanted a decent job without too much bullshit, a decent house, and a wife and a dog and sometimes on saturdays we\u2019d go to a museum. That would likely never happen. For the past couple weeks I\u2019ve felt horrible. Seeing the nice life my parents have then being thrown out in the world to attempt to build that myself.

And then you both stole it all. Art you whored me out to numerous of your high profile clients and friends who happened to be closeted homosexuals who had their way with me when I was 12. I still remember breaking my tooth on Jeffrey Golob&#039;s dick while he forced me to suck it. And remember the time you shoved your ass into my face and forced me to &quot;lick the chocolate?&quot;  But that wasn\u2019t even the bad part.

But I seriously can not remember the last time I masturbated only once a day. Usual for me is 2-4 times. I&#039;ve only recently started using pocket pussys because of death grip and whatever. I&#039;ve been like this since I was like 15 years old. I lost my virginity when I was 17 and even then it didn&#039;t go well because I couldn&#039;t get it up. I just assumed it was virgin performance anxiety but it happened again. and again. and again. and again. I eventually fucked her once but I swear it was one of the hardest things in my life to get it up and keep it up I rammed the fuck out of her pussy for like 20 minutes. Years have gone by and I&#039;ve had plenty of women who have had intentions of letting me fuck but I can never fucking get an erection even with foreplay. I usually eat her out/finger her until she cums so I don&#039;t feel like a complete failure then go with the &quot;wow this is crazy it&#039;s never happened before&quot; bullshit.
