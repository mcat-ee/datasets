Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "701673300"}, {"teaser": "pictureswap.org thread, post what you get lets make it fun", "threadId": "701673379"}, {"teaser": "Cute hanged girls - LOLI edition", "threadId": "701673458"}, {"teaser": "Skipping college today.

Not a copy of the big bang, not a simulation but the big bang itself. First of all they must discover a way to defeat time, not an easy task. Before the big bang time didn\u2019t exist a concept as hard for our monkey brains to grasp as it is hard for as to see ultraviolet light. That is to say we are not evolved to think in these terms and so it is virtually impossible. But there must exist a dimension before/outside of time possibly with different laws that govern it. What if hypothetically a device was invented to access this other dimension if time doesn&#039;t exist in this dimension the present and the big bang are simultaneously happening. What if the accessing of this dimension was the causation of the big bang when a timeless dimension is accessed what if (and this is a pretty fucking big what if) the result is the big bang. Giving the universe a feedback loop where it creates itself. Couple this with the singularity theory. If the theory is carried to its limits proponents of it state that an artificial intelligence could create von neumann devices capable of manipulating atoms and rearranging their makeup to create new atoms. The artificial intelligence could convert all accessible manner into computing power essentially amassing a huge brain. Say when the intelligence got to this point it understood the universe on a deep enough level to calculate that it is the only thing logically existent and that ever will ever exist that could be cable or creating the universe. The intelligence set its primary objective to the creation of the big bang. The intelligence predicts with extremely high certainty a method that will accomplish the task. It can run highly accurate simulations of the task and assess the most accurate way to do it.

Basically whenever I notice something surreal or feel detached or disassociated, I count the fingers on my hands. I later learned this was a trick for lucid dreaming. I started trying it and eventually, when I had fallen asleep on his couch one afternoon, found myself dreaming of being in an airplane with another close friend. Eventually when I noticed how unusual the situation was, I had formed enough of a habit to check my hands. When I found I couldn&#039;t seem to distinguish my fingers or how many there were, I started to panic and woke myself up trying to hit my face.  Also, has anybody had recurring experiences where you&#039;re perpetually &quot;waking up&quot; inside your dream? This afternoon I was taking a 45 minute catnap from 2:15 to 3 and had some music in (pic related). I remember it being dark in my room and checking my phone, which read 4 PM. I tried to get out of bed only to find myself waking up again, this time it was a quarter past 3.

Forcing people to leave their security in the hands of a governing body is not only preposterous, but out right criminal. It is impossible for a government to protect their citizens 24/7, a police officer takes minutes (after a phone call has been made, if it ever was made) to get to the scene of a crime. If the citizen of a country that has forcefully disarmed it&#039;s citizens by means of confiscation or threat of criminal charges gets harmed in a situation where the use of an outlawed weapon could have protected them, THEN the governing body of that country should be held accountable and compensate the individual or their family for the failure to effectively prevent or stop the crime from being committed. We all know this would never happen, but it details just how ignorant and ridiculous we as a people have become. EVERY MAN HAS THE RIGHT TO A FIREARM, NO EXCEPTIONS. There is no morally sound counter argument against this. Some might claim that the safety of the majority is at greater risk if people are allowed to carry weapons, the problem with that logic is that they are assuming that the current governing order is protecting them now, when its been stated earlier that it isnt. A criminal will break the law regardless, there are men walking passed you everyday that can have a concealed gun, legal or not. Anti Gunner&#039;s fear does not arise from the idea of firearms, but from the idea of having to be responsible for their own safety. (an ignorant idea, since the responsibility has always been there, just covered with theater) This argument also extends to the type of weapons one man can carry. A man has every right to carry a weapon that matches the force of a criminal, but one is wise to remember that the path to criminal intend has a history of being walked by both regular citizens and governments.

The night before, my girlfriend asked me if it would be alright for him to crash at our place. I objected of course, but then she got really upset and started crying because I wasn&#039;t being supportive. They have a child together and she wanted her son to be able to spend some time with his father. I felt really conflicted because I have been filling in as the boys father for the past 3 years. I&#039;ve taken him shopping for school clothes, I take him to school every morning and I&#039;ve spent hundreds of hours helping him with his homework. She went to go pick him up @ 7am. I called her around 12pm to ask her if she wanted to have lunch with me and it quickly became apparent that she was in the act of having sex while talking to me on the phone. I called her out for it and she didn&#039;t deny it. It sounded like she just dropped the phone on the floor. I listened to her get railed for as long as I could take it, but I eventually broke down in tears and hung up the phone. Before I got off of work Friday afternoon, my girlfriend sent me this snapchat. Of course, I&#039;m furious about it. I&#039;ve never been this angry. I went home to confront the man in my house and as soon as I saw him he grabbed me by the throat and pushed me into the corner of my foyer. He made it very clear that he was physically stronger than me, but he didn&#039;t strike me. He told me to go get him a beer. I looked at my girlfriend and she wouldn&#039;t make eye contact with me. After I got his beer and gave it to him, I spent all of last weekend listening to them fuck in my bedroom. They never stopped. 4 whole days of fucking non stop and she was extremely loud. I think he&#039;s dealing drugs out of my house, now. If I call the cops, I could be charged with maintaining a dwelling for the distribution of narcotics and my house could be seized and auctioned.

Her name is Kayse Green, she&#039;s 23 y/o, and lives on 360 Avocado Place, Camarillo CA. I was supposed to be in a long-term relationship with her. Then I figured it out. She is actually a manipulative, cheating, lying person who blames most of her bullshit as some sort of naive misguidance, even if it comes off autistic at times. She&#039;s done this to me, to one of my friends, and to a 16 year old kid who also wanted to be with her for when he grew up. Yeah, a consenting non-adult. Her behavior is unacceptable. She&#039;s caused quite a lot of mental fatigue, stress, etc. However most of all, this 16 y/o had a mental breakdown, and almost killed himself over what she had done to him. I&#039;m not saying she&#039;s to blame for his mental instability, but what I am asking for, is help. Not advice, rather, I&#039;m looking for trolls, hackers, and anyone with a lot of free time and know-how to fuck with someone out of good-will. She needs to be abused, poked at, stalked, threatened. She needs to be psychologically tortured, the way she does so carelessly to other people. If you&#039;re up for it, you can use basic info I have (her skype name is &quot;kukuhasgaids&quot;, and her steam profile is this: &quot;http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073545543&quot;) and get a primer. I have no idea on where to begin with this kind of stuff. All I know is that she manipulates people, then removes them when she gets bored and gets away with it because most relationships she starts are LDR&#039;s. She has disgusting behaviors such as: Intentional neglect, claiming &quot;rape&quot; against one of her ex&#039;s (my friend) when he never met nor fucked her irl, pretending she&#039;s innocent when she isn&#039;t, etc. Hope some of you decide to help me out, it&#039;s evident she has no intention of stopping until she get&#039;s punished for it.", "threadId": "701739611"}, {"teaser": "What&#039;s his name again?", "threadId": "701739641"}, {"teaser": "b, which of these two t-shirts should i purchase?", "threadId": "701739645"}, {"teaser": "Hello /b/", "threadId": "701739646"}, {"teaser": "anyone know where to find the video of the guy fucking the mcchicken?", "threadId": "701739647"}, {"teaser": "&gt;be me &gt;have a passion for success &gt;realize programs, school and AP classes aren&#039;t enough &gt;realize I have to &quot;network&quot; &gt;ohshit.png &gt;vent to my drug dealer best friend (still a bro to this day) &gt;tells me to become friends to richfags &gt;good idea comrade &gt;befriend shallow low lives &gt;get buddy buddy and slowly escalate their dank to hard drugs &gt;all of them become addicts in senior year &gt;now, I can get recommendations from rich, respected adults from their drug-addled kids via by proxy through addiction &gt;no need to properly network, just coerce them to make thier friends talk about me like I&#039;m fucking Saint Teresa by threatening to take their drugs away &gt;rich snobs to scared to talk to dealers and too pansy to act up against me Am I a bad person /b/?", "threadId": "701739662"}, {"teaser": "Starting a kik fap group for these girls.

She said it was a massager that she used on her back and feet. I still would sneak into her room and steal it though. I thought it was really cool that it vibrated when you pressed the button. I&#039;d never seen anything like it before. When playing with it, I would rub it all over my body to see how it felt. I remember particularly enjoying rubbing it on my face. After catching me with it several times, my mom gave up and let me play with it for a while. Soon after that it was gone and I could never find it again. I remember asking my mom what happened to it, but I can&#039;t remember the response. I always cherished those memories as one of the coolest &quot;new things&quot; I had ever discovered.

She used to give me a lot of shit, she was so scared of mating with me because of her ex bf who cheated on her and treated her like shit. With time everything got pretty good, we started to getting on very well, unless she cheated on me with a girl I knew on a party. When she told me I got furious, I just squeezed a lit cigarete with my hand, and I felt no pain at all while doing this. I struggled but forgave her. Life went on and long story short, she cheated on me again, two times, with her ex and my old friend I didnt talk to. She told me this like a month after, because she was afraid that I would dump her. She didnt have sex with them or anything, just few kisses on a party of my, now exfriend too. Something broke deep inside me, I stopped talking to her for a month, but my friend, and her best friend told me that she was suicidal, drinking everyday, crying into her cellphone every night, she couldn&#039;t handle that I was drifting away from her life. After one party where I got drunk as fuck, I woke up and got a little bit horny, so I texted her that I want to see her today with a strong red lipstick on, white underwear, grey skirt and white top. I deepthroated her for an hour straight, and our relation started to look somehow normal. But now I don&#039;t give a shit about anything, I cant feel anything, everytime she cries and complains that I ignore her, don&#039;t care about her, and how much she needs to suffer for me to finally start treating her right, I just don&#039;t give a shit, even tho I still love her somehow, it just hurts so much that only thing I cared about and almost failed a year because we were arguing all the time gave me so much shit.  I honestly don&#039;t know what to do, because Im not a kind of guy that could ruthlessly use a girl that seems to love me so much. All think about is my driving licence exam I have in a 2 days.

Well I shall tell u. The truman show was a lie just like obama,Obama says Jesus was God&#039;s son,ah haw so we just need to find out who God is and we will find out who Jesus is. the bible states God is everyone&#039;s farther. Daddy is another word for father.according to Dillon the hacker,keemstar is big daddy keem. Therefore keemstar is God. We all know keemstar cheated on pyro with shrek and Dumbledore,in Harry potter Dumbledore has a white beard, Jesus is white. So is Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey has been exposed as Jesus.

We moved out when i was five and i occasionally would go back and visit my grandparents who stayed in that house. I didnt interact much with the bodies except digging down to a coffin and crushing a skull i found among rocks. As i grew up my parents divorced and sickness fell upon us both mental and physical, mom got cancer dad never told me, they both were more worried about me. I feel pain that is unexplained by medicine and quite a bit of memory loss. and i used to feel as if my mind was open and i would notice things others would not until i pointed it out. At age 14 I got mad and tired and began to force myself to steel my mind. I put pressure on my mind and sought experience from the elderly, they are the ones i am most comfortable talking to even now. I grew up turned 17, and learned enough about myself and my nature to close my mind, as i felt it. since then my mental illness disappeared and i was fine mostly. recently I spent the weekend over at my friends place, and i told him these stories. late at night as i tried to fall asleep, i remembered how my mind used to be open. curious as i am i fell into the meditative state i used to introspect in. and i opened my mind. (an aside: in the weeks prior to this as i would fall asleep i would hear the screams from my dreams of the past. thats how i began to remember open) I immediately felt the pop of my mind opening and percieved several presences most came and left some laughed others ignored me i called out to no one in particular and a familiar ancient came and tried to talk to me i instinctively tried to close my mind and mostly succeded i felt his annoyance he tried to keep chatting but since i was no longer responding he left. 1/2", "threadId": "701757968"}, {"teaser": "Sauce?", "threadId": "701757998"}, {"teaser": "Dubs gets her kik and nudes", "threadId": "701758028"}, {"teaser": "Forever the true queen /b/", "threadId": "701758051"}, {"teaser": "So, the Bin Laden family was very wealthy with oil, right?

I was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audiobook when I glanced up and saw the McDonald&#039;s worker I ordered outside having a cigarette. She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could eat in comfort again. I don&#039;t think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the McDonald&#039;s restaurant or drive through, but that is another story. I went to McDonald&#039;s for dinner tonight and got a McChicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. As I was driving to the second window the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked, &#039;why don&#039;t you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot where it is cold&#039;. That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don&#039;t want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy.  Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don&#039;t think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?

We have been running mostly continuously since 2012, with only a few gaps of service. As you have probably guessed, this is a /pol/ server. The goal of /pol/andcraft is to establish politically based factions that will work as governments. The server implements a custom resource pack to &quot;increase immersion&quot;. Put simply, we are for political roleplaying and generally having a good damn time.

I think of gross profit as (revenue - cost of goods)/revenue And in these two examples cogs seem the same to me, am I misunderstanding something or is the writer of this just wrong? Maybe this is gross profit from an investment standpoint rather than an operating one? -- Say you bought 10 of the items in the example above at $50 each and it took a year to sell them all. You would have to pay 10 x $50 = $500 up front for the goods. With a markup of 100% (or a 50% profit margin) you would be selling the items for $100 each and your gross sells for the year would be $1000. Your profit for the year (again remember you have a 50% profit margin) would be $500. But say you only bought 2 of the items, sold them, and then bought another 2 and continue this until you had sold 10 in total for the year? 10 items sold at $100 still equals $1000. You would have to lie out 2(items) x $50 (cost) = $100 but would still be selling 10 in . That $100 will bring you back $200 (remember it is with a 100% markup) in gross sales. You keep half of the sales and reinvest the other half ($100) for two more items. Again, after a year your gross sales is $1000, but you never invested more than $100. This gives you a gross profit of $900 (because you only invest $100) as opposed to the $500 gross profit in the first example.", "threadId": "701779429"}, {"teaser": "Post all of New York, 518 to start", "threadId": "701779483"}, {"teaser": "What should I say /b?", "threadId": "701779510"}, {"teaser": "Okay /b/ I&#039;ve always been a lurker, laughing, crying and watching all of you shitpost, but tonight is my first post, and it&#039;s a tough one for me. I&#039;m lonely, /b/. I have been for ten years. My family was abusive, they didn&#039;t want me, accept me, try to get to know me, or even bother with me. I was alone for the better part of my childhood, I&#039;m 19 now. My mother, my father, they hate each other and they take their anger out on each other and me as well. I suffer with depression, constant plagues of suicide and five unsuccessful attempts, the earliest at the age of 9. I&#039;ve been molested twice by the only man that was like a father to me, whom is now dead from lung cancer.  When I was 16 I met a girl, a beautiful girl that made the stars alight and the whispers of happiness grace my ears and possess my soul. We&#039;ll call her Lyssa. Lyssa was everything to me. She built me up, made me better, pulled me from the pit that I lived for my memorable life. Her family treated me with respect, they helped me get a job, find a college for me, explore my options for careers and even allowed me to stay with them for awhile. They bought me shoes, clothes, food, glasses, everything I needed but was never provided by those who didn&#039;t care. Lyssa left me, shortly before we were set to leave for college and begin our new lives together. She said it felt like we were settling down, married without the ring, and she wasn&#039;t ready. At the time I hated her, and I fell back down into the pit with no crevices in which to crawl out of. However, I left my home, went to college and now here I am. Sophomore year and I&#039;m lonely. No one looks at me, no one sees me, no one talks to me, no one asks about me. I think it&#039;s time to leave, maybe whatever next is better than this. There&#039;s no one for me, and I&#039;ve accepted that.  You guys... Just. You&#039;re the best /b/ros, and I love each and every one of you, and I do hope that you all find happiness in this life.", "threadId": "701779591"}, {"teaser": "can you guys remove this girl and put my picture beside him?", "threadId": "701779595"}, {"teaser": "What&#039;s /b/ drinking tonight?

It goes like this, a few years ago I started having wierd feelings, feelings of wanting no needing to hurt or even kill and I dont mean like &quot;Omg he is so annoying I wanna kill him.&quot; I literally kill someone like knife to an artery kind of stuff (I havnt actually done it though). It started out small almost unnoticable but now I notice it, alot. The thing is it isnt even a triggered thing it seems random. One minute I&#039;ll be playing a video game the next I&#039;ll wonder what i&#039;d be like to head with a door. Its still not overwhelming feeling and I do resist the urges but lately (about 10ish months ago) Ive been feeling emotionless and not completly in control of myself. Its like when Im surrounded I&#039;ll have emotions like happiness and saddness but when im alone it all fades and I just feel nothing not even emptiness. An example of this was with my dog gunner who we had to give away recently. He was my little buddy kind of like a son to me on the ride back from giving him away I cried alot but later and now when I look at the photos and think about what happened I just feel nothing. And yes I have been to a theripist but every time I went I was in a good mood so he never could help me (and the fact that he would never stop talking about himself). If im being honest suicide has been a thaught in my mind a few times but im not sure if I could do it even though I dont feel like I live for anything. So my big question is this what should I do? Should I tell my mom, or just keep it shut tight like ive been doin?

White dude with an asian fetish here. I&#039;ve been lucky a few times... I&#039;ve been to China, S.Korea and Japan (China and S.Korea were trips/leisure, Japan was due to work). I found the following to be true: Chinese girls: The Russian Asians.. While the few that are hot are mindblowingly hot, the vast majority are monkeys who stink. The older women/grandmas are tough bitches and the country itself is corrupt as fuck. China reminded me of mexico. Aha, that&#039;s it Chinese are the mexicans of asia. Even in their upscale areas, the women were just trashy as hell. S.Korean Girls: Man this place had potential but blew it. The women can be top-shelf hot but usually require plastic surgery to get there (S.Korea is the plastic surgery capital of the world). WAY more hotter/good looking women than China. Stylish too. Unfortunately, they&#039;ve gone down a dark road, literally. They&#039;ve begun emulating american black women. Twerking in music videos, trying to be all R&amp;B/Hip-hop, and glamorizing U.S ghetto/urban culture. Such a waste.  Japanese Girls: Simply the best of the best. Every women I saw when I first got off the plane was practically model level hot. Even the &quot;average&quot; girls there would be fawned over here in the states. And the class, oh the class. These girls are high class. Even their whores have a demeanor to them that screams class. And clean. Oh so fucking clean. I&#039;m still amazed by how fucking clean everyone was, the streets were, everything was. A clean and top-shelf culture right there folks. No wonder China and S.Korea have such an inferiority complex, it&#039;s completely justified in my experience.  Right now, I&#039;m more disappointed with S.Korea. They had the potential to match or even exceed Japan but squandered it on plastic surgery and trying to act like nigglets. They could have evolved their own culture instead they&#039;re trying to adopt the worst part of U.S culture.

Prior to this day, everything was fine. Between us, at least. Or so I thought. There was an exception to all of this, because around the 3rd or so of June, Marissa had a bad day at Hot Topic because she got in trouble for calling in. She locked her keys in her car at her job at Dunkin, and she had her tattoo appointment still that day before work at Hot Topic. Her sister took her to her tattoo appointment, but not work, so Marissa called in. Because of this and Hot Topic finding out, they told her she needs to set her priorities and that tattoos aren&#039;t more important. Well it upset her, and there was a lot of drama, and thus caused a bad day. Well on my half, she got off around 10, and I was at home tired from work. I was drinking, playing video games, just relaxing. Ya know? She wanted me to drop what I was doing to come and comfort her, and while I could have, I also was struggling deep with my own inner issues. I never talk about myself or my problems, I just recently started being more open about my own problems and my depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, all that jazz. I was also beginning to have these weird triggers at the time where if a certain event happened, it would trigger a bad memory from my childhood. I&#039;m overall a very sensitive person with a very, very good memory which in itself is a gift and a curse. Theres a lot I wish I could forget from my past, which primarily is home issues, school issues, past relationships, shitty friends. I remember practically everything and if it hurt, it left a scar I never talked about.

The goal of /pol/andcraft is to establish politically based factions that will work as governments. The server implements a custom resource pack to &quot;increase immersion&quot;. Put simply, we are for political roleplaying and generally having a good damn time. It&#039;s a pretty rules light server and the only real thing that will get you banned is combat hacking, besides that we&#039;re pretty loose about what happens. We allow cracked clients, download one if you&#039;re interested in playing.

I touch it gently, with two fingers, the index and ring just spreading her sweet innie, and with a third, the middle one, slowly massaging her clit. She moans, almost like a purr, her back and bottom arching towards me, as I penetrate her gently, with a loving thrusting motion, I begin finger banging her. I press my thumb against her butthole, just tickling, then trying to push it in. She whispers &quot;Oh, I want you to f-fuck me already...&quot; as I pop out the finger, and do as she tells me.  I turn her on her stomach, while she lifts her bum in the air, my raging boner standing at attention as if this was the first time I saw her. I press it against her moist pussy, slowly entering her, and stretching, while she bites the pillow. I start thrusting, and she feels the whole length of my erect member, I grab her hair and pull it. She clearly likes it, like the bad girl she is, and that obviously requires some spanking, as I slap her asscheeks while fucking her vigorously, pumping into her tight vagina as fast as I can. She can&#039;t hold it much longer, I feel her orgasm coming on, the walls of her cunt gripping me tightly.  With a single highpitched moan, she squirts all over, trembling, the mere sight encouraging me to continue fucking her as fast as I can, as she goes on and takes it all. Her cheeks red and her eyes rolled back in ecstasy, I cannot help but start cumming myself, I spread her asscheeks and empty my seed in her womb.
