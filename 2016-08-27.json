Far from it - he is an idiot in many ways. But he&#039;s far less dangerous and malicious than Hillary.  How can you not see the evil beaming from her eyes and laughter? All she cares about is herself. She&#039;ll say and do anything to get elected, and all of you are following her like brainwashed sheep - exactly what she wants. She is an awful awful person.  The number 1 problem facing America (and the world) today is terrorism. Hillary wants to increase refugee intake by 500%. Among them come bad people. It&#039;s not complicated. Why oh why are they swarming like ants to Western countries? Why aren&#039;t they going to Asian countries? Perhaps Mongolia, plenty of space there. Or developed countries in the middle east that share their religion and culture? Oh, and then after she let&#039;s the bad guys in - she&#039;ll take away our guns, too. So that we can&#039;t even protect ourselves from them. How great! Do you not realize what this means? Open your freaking eyes people. That&#039;s the main reason why I&#039;m voting Trump in November. I only just turned 18, but over the course of my life I developed something called CRITICAL THINKING. Which I sense all Hillary supporters lack.  Nevertheless, I am almost certain she&#039;ll win - because our country is full of fucking retards (and because the system is rigged).

Basically my thoughts are, I was doing an astronomy lab at my university with a long range thermal imaging camera (very expensive). I myself looked out over the ocean and saw images of an island 3.6 km away. Cool beans I thought. Started researching the camera specs for my lab report (500mm focal length lens etc) I began reading a lot about border control using thermal imaging between watchtowers spaced at 4km intervals, or the Navy using it to detect boats even farther away than that (100s of miles) I got to thinking about the horizon and how a ship disappears because of the curvature of the earth. Now, if the earth was a sphere the island I saw 3km away should be roughly 15ft below eye level (line of sight). Thermal imaging works on line of sight only, it doesn&#039;t bend, or curve. So then how are we capable of seeing so far on a round planet? What am I missing here or screwing up?

But this chain cannot be infinitely long, so there must be something that causes change without itself changing. This everyone understands to be God. &gt;The Argument of the First Cause In the world we can see that things are caused. But it is not possible for something to be the cause of itself, because this would entail that it exists prior to itself, which is a contradiction. If that by which it is caused is itself caused, then it too must have a cause. But this cannot be an infinitely long chain, so therefore there must be a cause which is not itself caused by anything further. This everyone understands to be God. &gt;The Argument from Contigency In the world we see things that are possible to be and possible not to be. In other words, perishable things. But if everything were contingent and thus capable of going out of existence, then, given infinite time, this possibility would be realized and nothing would exist now.

I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don&#039;t become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you&#039;re not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you&#039;re good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you&#039;re finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It&#039;s an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven&#039;t done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.", "threadId": "701247438"}, {"teaser": "no rules here", "threadId": "701247459"}, {"teaser": "Beard r8 thread", "threadId": "701247486"}, {"teaser": "lets make a YLYL thread", "threadId": "701247498"}, {"teaser": "Ask a fetish model anything part 2.

Girls tend to get better grades at school than boys. From kindergarten, girls show more self regulation than boys. They tend to follow rules, pay attention to specific instructions and details as well as display an overall sense of self discipline by working through long term assignments despite boredom and frustration. Girls are also more likely to choose their homework before indulging in relaxing activities like watching T.V, reading or surfing the internet. 2. Girls are better at mathematics and science. The sciences and math are considered subjects in which males are expected to perform better due to the higher enrollment of boys to classes like engineering, chemistry, and quantum mechanics. However, girls get overall higher grades in school making them better than boys in science, even if they are not comfortable with the subject. 3. Girls are better at making computer games. One always considers gaming as a male hobby with the media depicting boys as die-hard gamers and the stereotyped talent pool of game creators. A study by the University of Sussex revealed that girls were better computer programmers than boys, by creating a more complex coding system while designing their 3D role playing game. 4. Women can handle the stress of a job interview better. The University of Western Ontario found that women handle the stress of a job interview better than men. It was found that women come better prepared by researching on the company and having mock interviews with friends before the final day. Men, on the other hand, took things easy and only prepared at the last minute. 5. Women are more likely to survive a car accident. They say women are horrible drivers, but did you know men are 77% more likely to die in car accident?

Another arms race happens, a second Cold War.

I&#039;m picking up bits of interstellar snuff, but it&#039;s not from home. There are some people who are catching my signals with some huge radio dishes, we exchange radio pleasantries. They are saying are things like &#039;rotate 170 degrees and realign with the sun&#039;.I geoscopically rotate around until I align with the Sun. I need to make sure my dish is pointing homeward, I drift out of alignment occasionally. I respond with data about what happens when you leave the influence of the sun. I can still see it, but by now its a bright blob when I look homeward. I can&#039;t see anything I recognise anymore, its just a pin-prick of light in the darkness.

A mixture of loneliness and being abandoned. I am someone who has struggled with depression for some time now, which simply stops me from enjoying myself and having a good time, despite my efforts. A few months ago I met a girl, we instantly hit it off and a 2 months after said meeting we started dating. It was bliss, just pure and utter perfection, yea we had a few bumpy roads but the pros out-weighed the cons. But recently, mid-way through this summer, she started to distance herself from me. We would talk alot less. To the point where were a few days where we didn&#039;t talk at all because I got pissed at the fact that she was creating distance from me so I wouldn&#039;t try to create a conversation, and likewise, since she was creating said distance, she wouldn&#039;t talk either. About 3 weeks ago, about 11pm, we broke up. Why? Honestly...I can&#039;t really tell you because even I don&#039;t really know. Everyone I&#039;ve talked to about it just said the same thing &quot;There must be something else behind it&quot; It obviously destroyed me. I couldn&#039;t sleep for about 3 days. Because, although she definatly didn&#039;t cure it, she distracted me off of my depression. Even when she wasn&#039;t around I&#039;d just seem more cheerful. Today I belive I have found said reason. I went to a local fair with a friend of mine, I hate this type of shit but I wanted to distract myself. And I see her there. Standing, with another dude, making out. Now I&#039;m here on 4chan posting about it because no one else will give a shit. My shrink even upped the prices for regular checkups because he noticed how fucked up I am at the moment because he expects me to book even more sessions. I got nearly no &quot;real&quot; friends.

At the same time, a tornado is one of the most awe inspiring sights one can witness in nature, full of majesty and mystery. I\u2019m Bill Paxton. I play a storm chaser determined to confront that mystery, by getting as close as possible to a raging twister. (Part 2) You start that believing the twister is not just a weather condition.

And it is important to point out all the glorius examples of how can one turn in to a fucking circle (due to the loss of sides) seeing what some people have done in attemps of mating, and also, what the average comments are on this matter. Can you remember? &quot;fucking beta, you should not see her as something special, women are bitches, not even an exception&quot;. This pretty much sums it all. However, treating women worse than a pimp is just gonna hurt lots of people over the years including you. I defend that the idea is to find an adequate balance. For the devil&#039;s fucking sake, you are not going to get anywhere wearing fedoras like your life depends on it, or pointing out how cute or sensible or any special snowflake faggotry you are.

Yet taking it to the extreme where women are put below humans is just fucked up. And this is the main culture here in 4chan, showing nudes of exs, for example. My recomendation, just be you. Don&#039;t fucking force it. Don&#039;t go around roleplaying. Grow the fuck up.

On Aug 10th, I posted the following here on NEVER HILLARY: &quot;This post is directed to EXTREME never hillary readers. I want to tell you about Michael Trimm. He is a relatively new online/youtube investigative journalist. He has taken on the mission of helping to bring down the Hillary crime syndicate by doing exhaustive investigative research. His main focus is on issues revolving around the Clinton Foundation. The reason that I say that this is for extreme NeverHillary people, is that he goes into so much detail and depth that he will lose more casual hillary haters. Some of his youtube posts are over 1 1/2 hours. He is now encouraging others to jump in and help investigate. He recently even gave advice on how to use Torrent, VPNs, Linux, etc., so you can cover your tracks. You wouldn&#039;t want to find out too much, and end up in a body bag would you? Just to clarify, to my knowledge, Michael has never advocated hacking or anything illegal, just legitimate investigative methods. Anyway, EXTREME NeverHillary folks will definitely want to follow Michael on youtube and maybe join in on the investigation. Here is a link to one of his recent shows:&quot; ... [link no longer works] Shortly after I posted the above, Michael Trimm&#039;s online presence disappeared. Two of his followers have been able to resurrect two of his recent youtube videos from their own downloads, but all of the content on his youtube page has disappeared. One of his followers allegedly got a reply to an email. Michael allegedly claimed that he got a visit from some government agents, who told him that there was classified info in his videos, and that he must remove all of them. Since then, Michael seems to have disappeared, at least to his online audience. I hope that Michael is safe! If anyone knows of his whereabouts, please let me know.

For anyone who lives in downtown Chicago, you are hopefully aware about the ridiculousness of not being able to use a bathroom of high class restaurant just because you are not a paying customer. While quite a number of people of Chicago just assume &quot;That&#039;s just the way it is&quot;, we are here to put a stop to it once and for all. That is why Anonymous has decided to protest against this by unleashing Operation Royal Flush. This operation will involve remotely shutting off the water supply systems of every high class restaurant of downtown Chicago until they all change their policy to allow everyone to use their bathroom for free. We will keep their water remotely shut off until they publicly announce their policy change. If they do not change their policy, they will begin to lose business, and eventually go out of business, because of their ignorance and greed. Using a public bathroom is a human right, and no one else can tell you otherwise. Imagine the injustice of an incontinent elderly person, or someone in a wheelchair due to Cerebral Palsy, being told they can not use the bathroom because they are not a paying customer. In the amount of time it would take a family member and a snooty employee to argue, the incontinent elderly person and the person with Cerebral Palsy would have already pissed or shat themselves, then need to be cleaned up and have their clothing changed, and these restaurant employees probably still wouldn&#039;t let them take care of even that procedure due to their policy.

The story of how I got falsely accused of sexual harassment when I was in 8th grade and literally had my reputation ruined inside my family. I was a sperg back in the day and couldn&#039;t talk to girls at all. One day a new girl came in. She literally had the fucking feminazi glasses I shit you not. I was young and retarded so I thought she was kind of hot. ( Looking back now she was a nasty bitch). She got assigned to help my line. She seemed friendly enough and actually seemed kind of in to me. So one day I said she looked cute. She smiled and thanked me for the complement and we went about our business. The next day some of the corporate people came in and asked for me. I got fucking excited because I thought it was something good. I was cordial and talked happily with the guy but I began to notice how cold he was acting to me. He walked me back to the security office and I knew something was up. My heart dropped because I knew something was wrong. I was pulled into an office with two fat asses and they asked me questions. They asked if I spoke to any of the girls in my stand. I of course said I had before. They had me write a statement. I was shaking and afraid. They told me that I was reported for something. I asked what I was reported for and they told me what it was about. I denied the accusations of course but they wouldn&#039;t listen. My parents hated me for a while. My own mother called me a failure to my face.

Thing is our parents are divorced and mom (who we lived with) was seldom home, and we had &quot;our thing&quot; in secret. Any how, there I was playing Festers Quest on my NES and my sister walked in my room and locked the door. Mom had just called and told her she will come home late, and my sisters blue eyes had &quot;that&quot; look. She wanted to play, and I did not waist anytime and got up.  We never kiss (that be gross we are brother and sister after all), but we did alot of caressing and it was apparent to me she was horny in a way I never seen her before. She undressed her top but heft her skirt on and told me to laydown on my bead. Still hearing &quot;world theme&quot; from Festers Quest I watched her standing in my bed and looking down at me. She was bursting with hornyness and I was in her power. A strange feeling, up until now I had been the dominant in this &quot;relationship&quot;, she pulled up her skirt and showed me her pussy, she had just started to get a little hair down there. And I was rock hard seeing this, and she told me to be still. And I was. She slowly moved down to ride me, and I was thinking &quot;oh shit we are losing our virginity togheter&quot;. And we did. I feelt how it was to have a dick in my 14y sister, and fuck she was wet. Never would I meet some girl being this wet again. And she started riding me, looking in my eyes the whole time, being horny. Over world theme still playing from the NES. After about 40seconds in heaven I started ejaculating to my surprise, and fuck. I did not know what to do!

We have been running mostly continuously since 2012, with only a few gaps of service. As you have probably guessed, this is a /pol/ server. The goal of /pol/andcraft is to establish politically based factions that will work as &quot;governments&quot;. The server implements a custom resource pack to &quot;increase immersion&quot; into &quot;&quot;&quot;politics&quot;&quot;&quot;. Put simply, we are for political roleplaying and generally having a good damn time. It&#039;s a pretty rules light server and the only real thing that will get you banned is combat hacking, besides that we&#039;re pretty loose about what happens.

We have been running mostly continuously since 2012, with only a few gaps of service. As you have probably guessed, this is a /pol/ server.

Woman A is not wearing any make-up, and her features include clear skin, good teeth, large eyes with long lashes - as well as a moderate bust and hips. She has not had her appearance altered in anyway, that includes braces. Woman B, on the other hand, is wearing make-up. She has also had breast and hip implants. While woman A has natural, well-maintained nails, woman B attaches fake ones, along with fake eyelashes. Woman A&#039;s mother and grandmother were probably of equal attractiveness, and have passed down skin, beauty and health tips, while woman B gets her&#039;s off the internet.  Ask the man which one he&#039;d want to share his genes with and Woman B would normally be the lucky winner.  The point I&#039;m trying to make is that Woman A&#039;s genotype is her phenotype, while Woman B&#039;s phenotype is not her genotype. In other words Woman B&#039;s attractiveness is frabricated and a man who chooses her might wonder why her attractiveness was not passed on.  This is just a ramble so take it with a grain of salt. A woman who wears make-up everyday and is not required to for her work is simply insecure about her natural appearance. If make-up was reserved for special occasions it would save the wallet and also show people how much you care about the event or person to spend an hour or two in the mirror.  So this is pretty much how women have hacked the mating game, and how it&#039;s not just genetically attractive females getting hurt but the men who fall for it as well. However, If you&#039;re a &quot;who cares, got pussy&quot; guy then this won&#039;t concern you lol. I know most guys here would be happy with either of these women so...

The server implements a custom resource pack to &quot;increase immersion&quot; into &quot;&quot;&quot;politics&quot;&quot;&quot;. Put simply, we are for political roleplaying and generally having a good damn time.
