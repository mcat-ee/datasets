For 3 months I dated this woman, she&#039;s 28, I&#039;m 23.  She broke up with me 4 days ago because she didn&#039;t want to put effort in me, and wanted to work on herself instead (she has ADD). She works evening shifts, so she&#039;s home late. I always ask her if she arrived safely at her work, and picked her up at the train station at midnight and walk her home. Now, she finds that obsessive and strange because I reach out for her and care about her. She used to date this lazy faggot who just sat at home, smoked weed, sexually abused her and neglected her for 2 years. She says she has been single ever since, but has dated some other guys in the mean time and had sexual contact with them. I find it hard to accept the fact that she used to be a slut, but I did with all the willpower I had. I loved this girl like nothing else. I have been in a relationship with another girl for 3 years, got engaged and was about to get married. This bitch cheated on me, so I dumped her. I don&#039;t have interest in fucking chicks every now and then, I want to settle and make a future with one woman. This woman also wanted that, really bad. She said she wanted my children, wanted to live together, all in 3 months. She found it strange when I cared, and supported her when she struggled with life. I live about two hours away from her, and it&#039;s not cheap to travel back and forth on a daily basis. We had sex the third night, she broke down and cried and said she couldn&#039;t do it anymore. It had nothing to do with me, it was her own shit. I treated her right, I didn&#039;t force her and let her decide what way she wanted to go. She wasn&#039;t used to this. I just sat down and thought what the fuck was going on, and realized she was broken and I tried to soothe her.

The reason: in August, Sokolovsky posted a video on his YouTube channel showing him playing Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2014and catching actual pok\u00e9mons\u2014in the Temple on Blood, a local Orthodox church built to commemorate the murder of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. The police considers this to be a violation of the Russian law against mockery of religious beliefs. In the video, published on August 11, Sokolovsky derided the ban to play the game in churches. A Russian state news program had earlier shown a story about Pok\u00e9mon Go which warned players against catching pokemons on the state border or in churches, noting that such actions could result in a criminal case and jail time. However, in the video, Sokolovsky didn\u2019t seem concerned. \u201cWho can be offended by the fact that you\u2019re walking around a church with a smartphone?\u201d he asked before heading to the building. \u041b\u041e\u0412\u0418\u041c \u041f\u041e\u041a\u0415\u041c\u041e\u041d\u041e\u0412 \u0412 \u0426\u0415\u0420\u041a\u0412\u0418 [POKEMON GO \u041f\u0420\u0410\u041d\u041a] / Sokolovsky! It didn\u2019t play well. A week later, Valery Gorelykh, a spokesperson for the regional police department, said that the video will be checked for violations of law. He also expressed his personal opinion, saying that such \u201cpokemonists\u201d should be sent to jail for 5 years minimum, so that others would be discouraged from committing blasphemy. On September 2, Sokolovsky was detained. The police took the keys to his rented apartment from the bloger\u2019s landlord and came to arrest him early in the morning. The next day, a local court ruled to arrest him. Sokolovky is being charged with in mockery of religious beliefs, which is a criminal offense in Russia. Sokolovsky is known for his anticlerical views. In one of his previous videos he sharply criticized the way of life suggested by one of the Russian priests. A Ural publication Ura.ru even asked the police to check his statements for suggested extremist views.", "threadId": "702531113"}, {"teaser": "So atheist fags, what you gonna do when hell runs all over you, bruthah!

She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could eat in comfort again. I don&#039;t think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the McDonald&#039;s restaurant or drive through, but that is another story. I went to McDonald&#039;s for dinner tonight and got a McChicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. As I was driving to the second window the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked, &#039;why don&#039;t you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot where it is cold&#039;. That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don&#039;t want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy. Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don&#039;t think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?

Since we are probably going to take them on 2/3 of the 7 nights, I&#039;m wondering how big of an effect this hangover will have throughout the days. A friend of mine suggested I rather take cocaine, but she said It&#039;s quite addictive, and I&#039;m purely looking for this to be a once off time taking any drugs.

For the past year, I&#039;ve been in a DD/LG relationship with an amazing girl. We hit it off instantly and she&#039;s way kinkier than I ever will be. I hit the lottery with her, she&#039;s a solid 8/10 with a 10/10 personality. We had an amazing relationship until about two weeks ago. We got into a rather big argument and we didn&#039;t speak with each other for 3 full days. After 3 days, I contacted her and she told me to &quot;go away&quot;. A day has passed, no contact. Another day passes, and I was just getting ready to head to bed when I get a text from her saying &quot;You&#039;re doing fine without me.&quot; I said I wasn&#039;t, I was completely crashing down without her. And I was. She told me &quot;if I gave a rats ass, I would&#039;ve tried to talk to her way earlier&quot;. Truth is, I did want to talk to her, but I didn&#039;t want to make her even more mad or anything. I didn&#039;t want to add fuel to the fire. Granted, that is my fault. We talked it through, and we&#039;re back on speaking terms. But she&#039;s barely talking to me nowadays. She said that she&#039;s really busy with trying to get into college and getting a job at the same time, and I know that takes a big amount of time. Whilst we were talking about the whole argument thing, I asked her if she had any feelings for me. She said yes, but that they&#039;re declining. Now the part that&#039;s really confusing is the immediate next message she sent me: &quot;But I also don&#039;t want to break your heart into a million pieces&quot; Did she actually think about breaking up with me? Does she want to break up with me? There&#039;s more to the story. We&#039;re talking now, as I said, but not as much. We don&#039;t even say good night to each other anymore. As we&#039;re in a DD/LG relationship, she doesn&#039;t even refer to me as &quot;Daddy&quot; anymore.

Just to give you some background, she lived in me and my family&#039;s house before I was even born. As years went by and as I got older, things began to go downhill with her being in the house. Some horrible events such as her almost burning the house down occurred a fair amount of times. This finally led to her being sent to a nursing home. Though it took a lot of pressure off of everyone to have her in an environment where people would be watching her, this event also lowered morale when she was first sent away. Now, a year and however many months later, her condition is worse. She sometimes doesn&#039;t remember me (even though there were countless times where I would have to stay at home to watch her). Her anxiety is through the roof and she sometimes gets physical. She packs up her clothes every single day thinking that she is going to return home, which breaks my heart. To add on to all of that, her first nursing home decided that she could no longer stay there and kicked her out (it was this whole Medicaid situation and the fact that my grandmother was running low on money... even though they said we were &quot;family&quot; and that they would help us with getting Medicaid). Today is the day she gets transported to a new facility. I feel horrible for my mother since she was under serious pressure to find a new place for my grandmother to stay. Having her at home can never be an option at this point because of how bad she has gotten. I had to help my mother through the process of applying for Medicaid and that was just a great pain. This whole situation has just left me feeling blue and I&#039;m worrying about my grandmother since I know she will not react well to being in a totally random place. It&#039;s just hard to experience this, especially since I have dealt with my grandmother&#039;s worsening condition for a long time.

All have sinned and therefore cannot enter into Heaven on their own accord Isaiah 53:6, \u201cAll we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&quot; Romans 3:23, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d  Romans 3:10, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d 2. There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3. Jesus lived a sinless life and shed his blood on the cross so we could be forgiven. John 3:16, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d 1st Timothy 1:15, \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\u201d 4. Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "702551592"}, {"teaser": "Wanna see the fucked up shit on youtube ?", "threadId": "702551596"}, {"teaser": "fuck it start rolling", "threadId": "702551682"}, {"teaser": "Reaction thread", "threadId": "702551706"}, {"teaser": "Horny, send pics", "threadId": "702551753"}, {"teaser": "Cleavage, post them.", "threadId": "702551796"}, {"teaser": "All the men in my family have full heads of hair with no graying.

Kratom is a plant from Thailand in the same family as coffee. The DEA wants to make Kratom a Schedule I substance on September 30th. Kratom does not get you high, it has very few negative side effects, and it is not addictive like poisonous opiate painkillers. The DEA claims that 15 people have died from Kratom, but they conveniently leave out the fact that every single one of those deaths also involved other chemicals. A Swedish study even found that Kratom was likely not the cause in all of those deaths. I need your help, /b/. Please sign this petition, which is unlike many petitions you have seen in the past. One of the ways we can fight the scheduling decision legally is if people generally disagree with the scheduling decision, and lawyers examining the law believe that this petition is the strongest evidence that many people do not support scheduling this harmless plant. If you vote, please don&#039;t forget to verify your email by clicking the link in your email after you&#039;ve signed. https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance Also, if you are so inclined, we could really use your support in writing to your elected representatives. The American Kratom Association has released a Call to Action which contains lots of ways you can help to support this harmless plant and the many tens of thousands of people in the United States who are helped by Kratom. http://www.americankratom.org/national_call_to_action Thank you very much for your time.

I could write a book exactly what was going on but to just save some time I will just say this. My job was threating me for months to fire me because I wasn\u2019t selling services and I was on my final. The people that have been hired in the last couple of months were the worst. They were basically friends of people that already worked at the store. They were lazy and didn\u2019t give a shit about anything all they did was talk to each other. Usually the work load fell on to me and a couple of others. It\u2019s also hard to report them when most of them were drinking with the managers after work. My manager was a complete jackass who played favoritism on people. The ones that I was cool with when I first started left or found something better.

Kratom is a plant from Thailand in the same family as coffee. The DEA wants to make Kratom a Schedule I substance on September 30th. Kratom does not get you high, it has very few negative side effects, and it is not addictive like poisonous opiate painkillers. The DEA claims that 15 people have died from Kratom, but they conveniently leave out the fact that every single one of those deaths also involved other chemicals. A Swedish study even found that Kratom was likely not the cause in all of those deaths. I need your help, /b/. Please sign this petition, which is unlike many petitions you have seen in the past. One of the ways we can fight the scheduling decision legally is if people generally disagree with the scheduling decision, and lawyers examining the law believe that this petition is the strongest evidence that many people do not support scheduling this harmless plant.

Through 8th grade until now (I&#039;m a high school senior) I defended these guys from bullies and other assholes looking to pick on them. They&#039;re all kinda weak and squeamish. I felt like I was doing the right thing. I also became really attracted to a girl in this group of friends. However she started going out with another guy in this group, who knows I like her. I felt betrayed. It also came to my attention that absolutely none of these people show any interest in me, whatsoever. Any time i talk about myself (which I do very rarely) I get zero response. It&#039;s not like they don&#039;t talk about themselves either. I enjoy hearing about their lives and what they&#039;re doing and how they&#039;re feeling. So for these reasons, I&#039;ve decided to stop talking to them. I feel like a part of me just died. As cheesy as it sounds, I actually loved these guys. i felt like they&#039;re the only friends I&#039;ve ever made, but they don&#039;t give a shit about me. I feel heartbroken.

This helps with my severe social and general anxiety but I know it won&#039;t last for long obviously.  I&#039;m also getting tegretol now at 200mg twice a day to help with anxiety. It helps some but I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s something else out there that would work better? Benzos are out of the question and he told me if I feel like it&#039;s not working that he&#039;d bump it up a notch with something else. I&#039;m considering asking for something else that falls under the GABA receptor agonist category but not sure if there really is anything out there for anxiety that would work better? My body has always metabolized drugs like no other.  Anyone have any suggestions of GABA receptor agonists that aren&#039;t benzos which truly hit anxiety head on? I obviously face it as this is the only way to get better but I was born with this shit and it sucks.

Over the past few months, he has continued to inform me that this was &quot;the funniest, most outrageous website&quot; he has seen. I favoured this, because, my son has only one friend and had always seemed terribly miserable. After he visited this site, he started to become happier. That is, until last month when his actions then started turning dark and evil. 18th of March, I caught him masturbating to these underage e-sluts over the Internet. I couldn&#039;t believe it, my son, who is much too young for sex is playing with the devil. A few weeks later on the 29th of March I find Charles wrapping Cre (our family cat) in toilet paper and attempting to set the toilet paper on fire. As of Tuesday, which has finally concluded my search for his X-factor contributing to his actions lead me here. I come home to find my son Charles, skipped school, and in the bathroom I find poor Cre&#039;s head in the toilet and his body set on fire, I was HORRIFIED. He tells me that &quot;4chan&quot; showed him these things. I immediately search this particular board, as he tells me this is the only side he has visited and what I find are the most EVIL of sins here. Upon my first few searches, I find such sickening Child Pornography and foul pictures of women with surgically attached penises onto themselves. As of my search yesterday, I find these HORRENDOUS photos of animals mutilated, decapitated, mauled, abused, and set on fire. I had to stop there as I started to heave up my lunch.

I&#039;m fucking crying because of how stupid I am.  Okay, so my girlfriend was supposed to come over to my house today because I was going to go take her to a movie. She lives about 20 minutes away, and the movie we were supposed to see started at 4:15, which was in about 40 minutes. I figured &quot;cool, I&#039;ll just play Pokemon while I wait&quot;. So I&#039;m playing Pokemon, and having a pretty damn good time. Anyway, she finally does show up, except she&#039;s crying as she walks into my room. Instead of doing the right thing by comforting her, I half-focus on my game and her. She starts telling me her cat died, and just as she was getting into it, I get into a random encounter in my game.   A shiny pidgey. Holy shit. (For those of you who don&#039;t know/care, shiny pokemon have less than a 1/1000 chance of appearing). I stare into my screen in amazement, yelling &quot;holy shit, YES&quot;, interrupting her mid-story. She sobs more, and she starts to yell &quot;You don&#039;t even fucking care! YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY YOUR FUCKING GAME!&quot; I&#039;m still looking at my screen, still focusing on catching my shiny pidgey, when she walks over, and tosses the game against the wall. I run over and pick up my DS hoping that nothing has changed on screen, and quickly noticed that she broke it. My system and my shiny pidgey, gone forever.   I start screaming every obsenity I know, and started flailing my arms around. I didn&#039;t know she was behind me, and appearantly I backhanded her in the face while I was being a dumbass and swinging my fists around. She yells out &quot;FUCK YOU&quot;, and runs out of my house in tears. What have I done? I&#039;ve fucked up so badly, and I need to know how to approach her.

Kratom is a plant from Thailand in the same family as coffee. The DEA wants to make Kratom a Schedule I substance on September 30th. Kratom does not get you high, it has very few negative side effects, and it is not addictive like poisonous opiate painkillers. The DEA claims that 15 people have died from Kratom, but they conveniently leave out the fact that every single one of those deaths also involved other chemicals. A Swedish study even found that Kratom was likely not the cause in all of those deaths. I need your help, /b/. Please sign this petition, which is unlike many petitions you have seen in the past. One of the ways we can fight the scheduling decision legally is if people generally disagree with the scheduling decision, and lawyers examining the law believe that this petition is the strongest evidence that many people do not support scheduling this harmless plant. If you vote, please don&#039;t forget to verify your email by clicking the link in your email after you&#039;ve signed. https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance Also, if you are so inclined, we could really use your support in writing to your elected representatives. The American Kratom Association has released a Call to Action which contains lots of ways you can help to support this harmless plant and the many tens of thousands of people in the United States who are helped by Kratom. http://www.americankratom.org/national_call_to_action Thank you very much for your time.

Over the past few months, he has continued to inform me that this was &quot;the funniest, most outrageous website&quot; he has seen. I favoured this, because, my son has only one friend and had always seemed terribly miserable. After he visited this site, he started to become happier. That is, until last month when his actions then started turning dark and evil. 18th of March, I caught him masturbating to these underage e-sluts over the Internet. I couldn&#039;t believe it, my son, who is much too young for sex is playing with the devil. A few weeks later on the 29th of March I find Charles wrapping Cre (our family cat) in toilet paper and attempting to set the toilet paper on fire. As of Tuesday, which has finally concluded my search for his X-factor contributing to his actions lead me here. I come home to find my son Charles, skipped school, and in the bathroom I find poor Cre&#039;s head in the toilet and his body set on fire, I was HORRIFIED. He tells me that &quot;4chan&quot; showed him these things. I immediately search this particular board, as he tells me this is the only side he has visited and what I find are the most EVIL of sins here. Upon my first few searches, I find such sickening Child Pornography and foul pictures of women with surgically attached penises onto themselves. As of my search yesterday, I find these HORRENDOUS photos of animals mutilated, decapitated, mauled, abused, and set on fire. I had to stop there as I started to heave up my lunch. This site has permanently punctured my son&#039;s mind, and I WILL be taking further action through the Internet officials .

Approximately 40% of all manmade CO2 is successfully absorbed by the environment. This means roughly 60% of manmade CO2 is not absorbed and thus increases atmospheric CO2. We may therefore say we need to reduce global CO2 production by around 60% to reach a break even point - but this ignores the fact that absorption rises along with our production. Still, something around this number can be found in the scientific research. &quot;In order to stabilize CO2 concentrations at about 450 ppm by 2050, global emissions would have to decline by about 60%. Industrialized countries greenhouse gas emissions would have to decline by about 80%.&quot; according to Barack Obama&#039;s Presidential Climate Action Plan 80% - And all our proposed plans (if fully executed) would reduce emissions by less than 5%. The United States accounts for about 17% of manmade CO2. Japan, 4%. Korea, 2%. European nations between 1 and 2 percent each. China and the developing world account for over 47% of manmade CO2. So if you wiped out all of the US, all of Europe, Japan, and Korea, and then managed to reduce China by around 25%, you would be near the break even point for CO2 absorption. Perhaps you start to see now what we are actually facing here.

In 2013, I found an iPhone 5C on the street in the middle of a snowstorm. Its screen was badly cracked, the glass falling off in tiny chips, and wasn&#039;t responding to touch. It was in the middle of the night and I was on my way home from work, no houses or people around, and I only became aware of it because an alarm was going off loudly. It&#039;s also very brightly colored, and was half sticking out of the snow. Thinking I could later connect it to iTunes and figure out who owned it, I pocketed the phone. At that time I lived in a relatively small town and thought I&#039;d get bad small-town karma if I kept it altogether. Now, I don&#039;t know if I was just doing it wrong, but for some reason the phone was unrecognizable to iTunes and my laptop. So I stuck the phone in a drawer, figuring maybe I&#039;d hear about someone who lost their phone around town in the coming days. It stayed in that drawer for two years. Last year, my old faithful finally died, and that&#039;s when I remembered the iPhone. It was a bit of a blessing, and (doing no prior research like an idiot), I decided to have the phone repaired rather than buy a new one. My logic was that I never had an Apple phone before, and I had once heard they had more memory and a longer batty life. Plus, repairing its screen at the time costed the same amount as buying a regular phone. My good luck was further confirmed when the man who repaired it told me he had to wipe the old password from the phone, because the broken screen had somehow caused it to lock out. Something about passwords being randomly entered after the logic board cracked. &gt;part 1/2", "threadId": "702614914"}, {"teaser": "&gt; Mind numbing cynicism and edge incoming How the fuck do people do it anymore?

We went to a club with the work lot, and I sat with B for a cigarette. She was a bit tipsy and started telling me the story of her breakdowns.  She told me she has a boyfriend and they were dating for about 4 years now, and she was telling me that she is very unhappy because her current boyfriend is very abusive towards her. I started investigating on this, but not a lot, didn&#039;t know how serious it was. This night was extremely hard. We went to the club again, she came as well (without her bf because he is banned from the club). The bf was worried that B might cheat on him with one of us, so he sent his boys to look for him. Note, apparently he is extremely dangerous, he has a gang of other crewmates that really did bad stuff. Now this night, she was dancing with another co-worker, it was a friendly dance, but B&#039;s bf friends thought it was more serious, so when everyone left, she pretty much got kidnapped by her bf and his friends into his car (she was saying that she will get proper beat up) When me and my other 2 mates saw what happened, we got into our own car and we started following it down. Luckily the police thought we were drunk and driving, so they followed us as well. At a car park we stopped and told the officers what is happening. They came with us, but they couldnt do much at that moment, B when in the police&#039;s car and stood there while they left, in the meantime we were parked 10 feet away. B&#039;s boyfriend took her wallet and keys, so I let her crash around mine. She has a meeting with the police in a couple of days, but she said she doesnt what to confess anything, otherwise her or her parents will have to suffer a lot. What should I do? I really need help and guidance on what to do next.", "threadId": "702646343"}, {"teaser": "How do I make my small cock bigger? pic related muh dick", "threadId": "702646361"}, {"teaser": "Here&#039;s the story of my first pet &gt;Be me &gt;14 year old kid, gets bullied a lot and parents never home &gt;Friend introduces me to alcohol &gt;Be me 20 years later Im a heavy drinker &gt;Failed two marriages and never became more than a fry cook at a local restaurant &gt;I sober up, get a girlfriend, get a better job &gt;Buy a hamster as a sign of my responsibility &gt;Relapse a week later and murder/sexually molest hamster while intoxicated &gt;Feels bad man", "threadId": "702646378"}, {"teaser": "Hey /b long time no see.
