I&#039;ve been playing Baccarat for a long time. My theory is you don&#039;t bet against the casino, nor work with other players to &quot;win&quot; at a table. You simply be the middle man in the situation of the gambling table. The dealer will give you an option to bet on either A or B &gt;6 people betting on A &gt;Total amount bet is $3000 &gt;1 person betting on B &gt;Total amount bet is $300 Either hand A or hand B will come up. So for this instance, betting on B would benefit you and benefit the casino. So they would let hand B come as the winner. You win $300 And the casino earns $2700. I learnt this when I was gambling at my local casino and found out that the electronic machines where all the cards being dealt are coming out of are somewhat &quot;magnetized&quot; with the table. The dealer will always have one hand on the card machine and move it left to right before he deals out the cards. The thing is, the dealer is deciding not whether a player should win or lose, but whether the next hand will win profit or not. I learnt this the hard way because I was threatened by security inside the casino for knowing too much, and as soon as I left I was followed by big people which looked like they were hired. I haven&#039;t set foot in a casino since to gamble, due to not risking &quot;stealing&quot; from them.

During the course of my intellectual pursuit, I have stumbled across this Internet site where users can post comments about a particular issue or topic and reply to other users&#039; postings - a message board - and I began pondering the existence of a certain product of the Crash Bandicoot series named &quot;Crash Advance Four.&quot; According to my person with whom one has a bond of mutual affection, typically one exclusive of sexual or family relations, the controls for said electronic video game were so that the button labelled &quot;A&quot; would cause the main protagonist - Crash Bandicoot - to spin uncontrollably for a short amount of time effectively giving him the ability to spin certain people who are actively opposed or hostile to someone or something away, while the button labelled &quot;B&quot; would cause the title character to push oneself off a surface and into the air by using the muscles in one&#039;s legs and feet. My aforementioned friend has communicated information to me in spoken or written words that his sister of his father or mother or the wife of his uncle from the region of Earth named &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot; had freely transferred the possession of this video game to himself, but alas, he now has become unable to find this product. He proceeds to tell me that he obtained this object in exchange for payment in a video game-related store that goes by the name &quot;GAME&quot; and that the thing which lies on, over, or around something, especially in order to protect or conceal it contained the previously mentioned video game character &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; holding a fictitious item in one of the end part of a his arms beyond the wrist, including the palm, fingers, and thumb.

Women simply don&#039;t want shit-coloured penises; that&#039;s a fact. Who&#039;d want to suck on a piece of shit unless they had some sort of scat fetish? Face it, niggers, your futile attempts at cucking us is making you look desperate and in dire need of pussy. But you won&#039;t get any. Not a single woman, white or black, wants black dick unless they have a mental disorder. Everyone wants our creamy white dick. No, not want, they NEED our creamy white dick. Even if your birth defected penises are an inch or two longer, most women will still prefer ours. Why? Because we know how to use it, and it doesn&#039;t look like something she just shat out 10 minutes prior. You niggers have attempted to reverse the roles given to you by society, but your rusty chains remain because you simply don&#039;t have enough intelligent thought to understand what kind of hornets nest you&#039;re prodding your shit-dicks into. That&#039;s the stuff you niggers have wet dreams over; imagining fucking your master&#039;s wives, sisters and mothers because it&#039;s what we&#039;ve done to you for so long. It&#039;s understandable really, you just want a little piece of the cake, but like a dog, you will remain on the floor and receive only tidbits we throw your way. And that&#039;s only if you&#039;re lucky. All two ounces of your nigger brain is fighting against what we&#039;re doing, but you can&#039;t stop us. We already won hundreds of years ago, and your women are thankful for us. We provide them with homes, infrastructure, water, electricity, and of course, our creamy, white cocks, which they love to suck on. Take a look at Africa; when we freed you niggers and let you be, your wasteland became worse; plagued with disease and drout; poorly built shanty houses made from shit and twigs. You can&#039;t even get a clean source of water. This is irrefutable evidence as to why you need us. But we don&#039;t need you. Bow down, niggers.

But they were all of them deceived for another Shekel was made. In the land of Israel, in the fires of Jerusalem, the dark Lord Goldenstein forged in secret a master Shekel, to control all others and into this Shekel, he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life. One Shekel to rule them all. One by one the free lands of Western world fell to the power of the Shekel. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Jews and on the slopes of Jerusalem, they fought for the freedom of the western world. Victory was near but the power of the Shekel could not be undone. It was in this moment when all hope had faded that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father&#039;s sword... Goldenstein, the enemy of the free peoples of the Western world was defeated. The Shekel passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy Evil forever. But the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the Shekel of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.

The pyramids are basically made from cement. They consist of limestone and vegetable matter for the most part. All that would be needed is for a mold to be made and set in place at each location they wanted a block to be made. So, instead of moving these enormous blocks over vast distances all they had to do was start a chain gang of sorts. Handing the cement mixture (water, limestone, and vegetable matter) from hand to hand filling up the mold. After it dries just remove the mold and you now have a block that weighs tons, but never has to be moved. It would actually get somewhat easier the higher the construction went. Anyway, this is my theory.  &gt;Here is an interesting article that backs up this idea. http://io9.gizmodo.com/5869417/what-are-the-great-pyramids-really-made-out-of", "threadId": "700534403"}, {"teaser": "Andy Sixx thread?", "threadId": "700534404"}, {"teaser": "What does /b/ think of my new finger box?", "threadId": "700534428"}, {"teaser": "How do i look?", "threadId": "700534477"}, {"teaser": "So a 9 yr old called a faggot today where I work.

Women simply don&#039;t want shit-coloured penises; that&#039;s a fact. Who&#039;d want to suck on a piece of shit unless they had some sort of scat fetish? Face it, niggers, your futile attempts at cucking us is making you look desperate and in dire need of pussy. But you won&#039;t get any. Not a single woman, white or black, wants black dick unless they have a mental disorder. Everyone wants our creamy white dick. No, not want, they NEED our creamy white dick. Even if your birth defected penises are an inch or two longer, most women will still prefer ours. Why? Because we know how to use it, and it doesn&#039;t look like something she just shat out 10 minutes prior. You niggers have attempted to reverse the roles given to you by society, but your rusty chains remain because you simply don&#039;t have enough intelligent thought to understand what kind of hornets nest you&#039;re prodding your shit-dicks into.

We already won hundreds of years ago, and your women are thankful for us. We provide them with homes, infrastructure, water, electricity, and of course, our creamy, white cocks, which they love to suck on. Take a look at Africa; when we freed you niggers and let you be, your wasteland became worse; plagued with disease and drout; poorly built shanty houses made from shit and twigs.

Face it, niggers, your futile attempts at cucking us is making you look desperate and in dire need of pussy. But you won&#039;t get any.

We provide them with homes, infrastructure, water, electricity, and of course, our creamy, white cocks, which they love to suck on.

Insist on transparency in the money markets and company accounts... and forbid &quot;investements&quot; that are actually gambles, rather make sure that &quot;spare&quot; money from investors is put to building and creating infrastructure for public benefit, rather than investment funds that actually do nothing....?

I was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audiobook when I glanced up and saw the McDonald&#039;s worker I ordered outside having a cigarette. She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could eat in comfort again. I don&#039;t think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the McDonald&#039;s restaurant or drive through, but that is another story. I went to McDonald&#039;s for dinner tonight and got a McChicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. As I was driving to the second window the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked, &#039;why don&#039;t you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot where it is cold&#039;. That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don&#039;t want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy. Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don&#039;t think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?

The point of this thread is that we continue existing when we should have &quot;died&quot; even though we die in that reality and our consciousness or mind would hop into another where we would exist indefinitely. I have one personal examples. When was I was in highschool I would go to Oceans of Fun with my bro and friend every weekend because we got a season pass. I had a red two door sports car and speeded without a seat belt like a dip shit all the time. When we were merging onto I-35 South there was a portion that was hard to see due to it being a carved out mountain so when you were turning at high speed it was really impossible to see if there were cars stuck in traffic. As I am turning I see red lights, there is not enough time to slam on the brakes because of the speed and if I was to, I would get pancaked by the car behind me after i slammed into the car infront. I switch to the right lane without looking to see if there was a car in that lane. Could have died there also. As I am switching lanes, I was probably a few inches away from hitting the drivers side of my car with the rear passenger side of the car in front but I managed to switch lanes without any incident. As soon as we got out of that situation, Me, my bro and my buddy started to feel weird, like tingles in our bodies. Like sort of like an itch all over but it there was no desire to scratch. I even told them, I feel like we should have just died back there. Something felt different but everything felt mostly the same.

For once on 4Chan I hope for constructive critisism. Please only respond from reason and support. I&#039;ve been having a meltdown for nearly my whole life.

I eat them expecting results like super strength, good looks etc. Later it turns into a nightmare and I start getting visions of being in my house and creatures break in attacking me. Then it switches back to what feels like somebody else, but I think its me. A voice tells me to look toward the sky and it&#039;s been cloudy since the start and I start floating upward and the clouds turn into aurora lights and stars then I travel to a boat surrounded with people I live in an ocean and while this is all happening flashes and visions of being eaten by ugly creatures happen for few seconds and come back constantly. Then while I&#039;m on the boat Everybody starts yelling &quot;THE SUN THE SUN THE SUN THE SUN&quot;  I&#039;ve been having this dream for over a month and normaly it goes unnoticed due to me waking up and forgetting about it, but sometimes I wake up and begin re analyzing it. So later today when I got back from my weekly haircut as I drove up to the parking spot in my house and ran over my dog. The wheel just rode over it&#039;s head and crushed it. &gt;Currently devistated. I went outside and yelled &quot;SOL&quot; and the cloudy sky fucking split the fuck open and the sun revealed itself.  I don&#039;t know what any of this means.

Let me start from the beginning, I am 19 and my sister is 21. I just finished high school and my sister is home from college.

I walked inside her room to ask her what&#039;s up and she hands me a letter - apparently she&#039;s up for review by her college for dismissal. I feel kinda sorry for her so I gave her a hug and one thing led to another and we started making out. This is really weird because I&#039;ve made out with girls before, but my sister blows them all out of the water. In the back of my mind lies the fact that she&#039;s my sister and what we are doing is sick and wrong, but I guess my sister has more experience and it felt so FUCKING good. Here&#039;s the dilemma - after making out, Karen started taking her clothes off and she started pulling my pants down. I&#039;m like, hey, what are you doing? She&#039;s like, oh come on Jordan, aren&#039;t you even a LITTLE curious? I felt bad because its true, my sister is a hottie and I always wished that she wasn&#039;t my sister. I&#039;ve even gone as far as to fap to thoughts of doing her. She then said &quot;For tonight, let&#039;s not be brother and sister. I really need this because I feel like shit right now and our parents won&#039;t be back till late and we aren&#039;t going to tell anyone. I pretty much just fucked my sister.

I know the power this place has, and hopefully I can use the power of the collective to help me win something big. I am posting this at about 10:30 PM EST. There is 1.5 hours left in voting for this award. I am the host of a comedy talk show (That Midday Show) in Knoxville, TN on the smallest radio station (WOZO Radio) in this wonderful town.  Cityview Magazine holds a Best of Knoxville awards every year, and it has been brought to my attention tonight that I am running third in a tight race that ends in less than two hours.  So what I am asking is for a mission. Let&#039;s call it Operation Ballot Box Stuff.  If I can pull off the win in Best Local Radio Talk Show Host or Best Local Radio DJ or pull off the double it would be huge.  For me it would be huge because it could never fall off my resume. Win something like that could open doors that I never imagined. I mean I took this show everywhere and shopped it around for years before landing on WOZO Radio. To win would show those who said the show would never work on live radio.  For the folks who work on my show it would be a huge morale boost and would open doors to expand the show. For the station it would validate our little tiny station. It would be a win for not just me but the entire crew of over 40 DJs that invade the airwaves.  For the Knoxville media it would end the dominance of the 4 shows that trade this award every year. So please my brothers and sisters please help me stuff the ballot box.  If I win I will be forever indebted to the collective here on 4Chan. To vote for me I am nominated in the people category, Best Local Radio DJ and Best Local Radio Talk Show Host I am the first choice on each ballot Aaron Campbell  Here is the web address for the ballot. http://bestof.cityviewmag.com/cgi-bin/voting.pl Thanks if you help Aaron C.

Whether or not you believe any of it is irrelevant, if you were meant to believe you would be given the experiences necessary to convince you. Most of us are either meant to live with doubt of the afterlife, or utter disbelief in it, because of the unique experiences and trials it brings us.  Life is difficult because the only way to amplify our capacity for happiness and pleasure is to first experience the inverse, painful aspects of said pleasures. The darkest aspects of your life will become your greatest pleasures in the afterlife. The inverse of the most universal pains such as stress, boredom, heart break, etc, will of course be universal in the afterlife in the form of love, happiness, excitement, etc. Paranormal activity is ambiguous intentionally. Spirits are perfectly aware of their capabilities, but instead we receive tiny inklings of contact in order to perpetuate ambiguity and uncertainty. Spirits/aliens can do anything, if and only if it is beneficial for the growth of the collective consciousness. Everyone has a soul mate they are destined to live with for eternity, it will be your complementary consciousness and may exist either on earth as a body or as a spirit. Tulpae and waifus are generally soul mates. There are infinite colors in the universe, however the colors we see on earth are the fundamental colors that first began with the beginning of creation. First was gray, the whole, then black and white, chaos and purity, then the colors that come after. The true God is genderless and can appreciate anything, afterward is a god and a goddess, followed by other essence pairs.

The original series, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, was created for Hanna-Barbera Productions by writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears in 1969. This Saturday-morning cartoon series featured four teenagers\u2014Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville &quot;Shaggy&quot; Rogers\u2014and their talking brown Great Dane[3] named Scooby-Doo, who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps.[4] Following the success of the original series, Hanna-Barbera and its successor Warner Bros. Animation have produced numerous follow-up and spin-off animated series and several related works, including television specials and made-for-TV movies, a line of direct-to-video films, and two Warner Bros.\u2013produced theatrical feature films. Some versions of Scooby-Doo feature different variations on the show&#039;s supernatural theme, and include characters such as Scooby&#039;s cousin Scooby-Dum and nephew Scrappy-Doo in addition to or instead of some of the original characters. Scooby-Doo was originally broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1976, when it moved to ABC. ABC aired the show until canceling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, from 1988 until 1991. New Scooby-Doo series aired as part of Kids WB on The WB Network and its successor, The CW Network, from 2002 until 2008. Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2013,[5] and Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! debuted on Cartoon Network in 2015.[6] Repeats of the various Scooby-Doo series are broadcast frequently on Cartoon Network and its sister channel Boomerang in the United States as well as other countries.

Whenever I finish an anime or tv show, etc. I like to write something about it, it makes me feel better. I don&#039;t give a fuck if you think I&#039;m a weeb for watching it, I&#039;m just writing this because it helps me cope. I made a similar post 2 weeks ago when I finished the anime and I said that I was going to watch the movie last weekend, but I couldn&#039;t bring myself to do it. I&#039;ve never been to a funeral but I feel that on some divided scale that&#039;s what it feels like to go to a funeral. It was the end of something I had enjoyed for a long time.At first I watched it as a joke, thinking that the slice of life genre was worthless and could not have a compelling story. On paper K-On is a very dull anime but I still feel a deep connection with all of the characters. It manages to be funny at times and be sad at times without it feeling like a roller coaster but more like a road over hills. Every change in height is almost undetectable until your right there on top of it. Now that I am completely finished with K-On I feel even more empty than I did 2 weeks ago. I generally only watch one anime at a time so I suppose I&#039;ll have to move on to the next one.  I don&#039;t know whether to look for a long one or a short one. Whenever I watch something for a long time the implosion that happens at the end is devastating, more so than a short one. But I ask myself the question of &quot;do I want to feel something when I finish a show?&quot; Is saying goodbye a just price for being entertained?  Well, now that I feel better I&#039;m going to go take shit and then wank to some K-on r34. That&#039;ll cheer me up.

In times of martial law, neighborhoods and towns tend to still do the same thing. It&#039;s part of socioeconomic and human nature. That has NOTHING to do with modern times or the application of the 2nd Amendment though. And it ESPECIALLY has nothing to do with retards owning and being allowed to purchase guns with zero safety training or oversight. That shit is psychotic.&quot; So if gun&#039;s are invalid because it&#039;s now the modern age... does this mean you don&#039;t need freedom of Religion or Freedom of speech?

What do you think is going to be the solution? Traditional solution: War and incarceration is a great way to kill off surplus humans. Send the poor of our country off to kill the poor in another country. Keep shipping the canon fodder over there until surplus humans are eliminated. Those that won&#039;t go can be stored in prison. Fascist solution: Surplus population is simply rounded up and killed or at very least force sterilized and contained. No job? No balls and no freedom then. Problem will continue to take care of itself. Revolutionary solution: The unemployed surplus humans rise up and revolt and try to overthrow the employed elite. Eventually results in the complete collapse of modern civilization and humanity returns to a pre-industrialized agrarian economy after many decades of war, disease and famine. Planned economy solution: Transition to a post scarcity society, let the bots continue to do more and more of the work and basic guaranteed income means the number 1 occupation for humans is to buy stuff. Some humans will still be needed in jobs and will be better off but the gap between the poor and the rich is not as severe. People will be left to find their own meaning in life and pursue their passions and interests.

An outsider only hears the growling and when only one dog comes from beneath it\u2019s obvious who won. At the moment, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in Russia. There is no mention of this in the mainstream media, but for the past few years, the elites have been in a rigorous power play.

Child Pornography is a criminal offense and is defined as any visual depiction involving the use of a minor, or one appearing to be a minor, engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Visual depictions include photographs, film, video, pictures or computer-generated images or pictures, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means. Child pornography has become particularly problematic with the rise of the Internet and its ability to both transmit data far and wide and provide a level of anonymity to its users and the victims depicted in images of child pornography. Types of Depictions Any depiction of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct may be considered child pornography. This can include photographs, digital images, computer-generated images, drawings, videos, or animations, among others. This also applies if the person in the depiction is actually an adult but appears to be a minor. Moreover, altering an image or video so that it appears to depict a minor may also be child pornography (for example, editing the face of a minor onto the nude body of an adult in an image or video). what the fucking fuck is this fucking shit so they are saying ANYTHING can be cp and everything that solicits a sexual response from the viewer", "threadId": "700654885"}, {"teaser": "what the fuck was this movie about?", "threadId": "700655001"}, {"teaser": "Dox bread.

The second half gets a little better but not by much. There&#039;s a lot of repetition that is just stupid and scenes that make absolutely no sense and totally unconnected with the story. It was poorly written af and the editing with the flashbacks was just jarring and unconnected with the plot as well. (At least what they called a plot anyway). As with Batman v. Superman, I imagine the extended cut will make more sense. I really enjoyed the Batman stuff, I think Affleck is great in the role and elevates the material. I like his Batman because he&#039;s an asshole but in a good way. Christian Bale is just an asshole. But I look forward to a BatFleck feature film. Also Harley Quinn&#039;s performance was great. And the visuals and characteristics were I did find interesting, even though it was convoluted af. Not a big Will Smith fan but he was great too. I see what they were attempting to do with the Joker and it didn&#039;t bother me. He did come off a little cringy here and there but I didn&#039;t mind the crime boss stuff. Again, the material is fucked. Leto is a good actor but there&#039;s only so much you can do with shitty material. It&#039;s a different Joker, in a different Universe and I&#039;m ok with it. I did like the imagery of him surrounded by all his knives and how people were just terrified of him. I would have loved to see more of him in the movie and would be interested in seeing him again in another Batman feature, (opposite Affleck). It was just funky how they introduced him into the movie, one of the most iconic villains of all time. They should of had him try to foil the SQ&#039;s mission or watever.

So I&#039;m joining the military to go fight ISIS. Everything background check went cool and I scored a 91/99 on the ASVAB, and it sounds like the job I want is available.

So I have about 90% of what I need for mortgage and utilities this month, and if it goes late, I have to wait until it&#039;s current before I can join (Air Force has a moral code that includes financial responsibility).
