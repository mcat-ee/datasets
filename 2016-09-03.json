The DFB is the German Football association and in theory the finale of that cup should be, from a logical point of view, comparable to the Superbowl. In reality it turns out like every other league or international game. Singing the anthem, clap and then let&#039;s go for 2x45 minutes. It&#039;s not fancy nor trashy, it&#039;s nothing overhyped, it&#039;s just the game. Hell, even the World Championship finale isn&#039;t that much of a party until one team actually won.

It gives people a &quot;start for thinking&quot;, which accounts for a basic bipolarity: (non-deity-) agents have two high objectives: -existential/recurring personal liberation, for example from itch or death, and -moral activity which attempts, what seems to be best for all. This may seem abstract, but in the time it grew with me, it raised some heavy/influential consequences: - a bipolarity for the political landscape, that seems scalable from the individual to the whole of humanity, and that at the same time seems much more cooperative, as every human experiences both parties&#039; central objectives in his daily life.Ideally improving democracy&#039;s appeal for many. - some basic root thoughts for an artificial intelligence, that could invoke a reasoned, largely beneficial stance on humanity (in case you mind: see &quot;control problem&quot;) (continued)", "threadId": "702256493"}, {"teaser": "Dick rate thread?

They charged me the equivalent of $300 for a new 1tb hard drive, even though I was quoted much less. The owners response was I must just deal with it or I don&#039;t get my computer back. When I got my computer home it didn&#039;t work, and it only had a 500gb hard-drive not a 1tb hard drive. I left a review on fb asking them why they did this yet they denied ever doing such a thing. I never received an invoice so I have no proof. The owner said that because I called him an asshole (which I did, because he is one) he doesn&#039;t have to give me what I paid for. I have no recourse as I have no invoice. In addition to that   he removed 4gb of ram, as when I took it in I had 8, now I only have 4. I have called and emailed but they just ignore me. Facebook is useless as the just delete my posts and threaten defamation. I&#039;m at a loss as the owner is a big guy and just intimidates his customers, and I can&#039;t even find his name out.

An updated version has the &quot;drunken inhibitions&quot; patch. &gt;Newlywed Wife bestowed with the unique organic components which allows her to get impregnated (only her stomach will swell, she will never gain weight or age; capable of giving birth every 9 1/2 months). She will treat you like a king. She only asks that you cum in her/on her. Mother-like qualities has been added as a new feature. &gt;Shy but eager virgin that desires to be broken in. Treat her like a princess and she will reward you with much devoted surprises. Hymen will be restored upon personality/memory reset.

Gambling: I\u2019d always thought my 7/10 girlfriend\u2019s biggest flaw was her gambling problem. Worst example; the week before we moved in (i.e. deposit paid) she got drunk and gambled away the last \u00a32k of her savings. Smoking: I knew she was a smoker, but I didn&#039;t know she was a heavy smoker, 15-20 cigs a day. Drinking: She wouldn&#039;t drink whole bottles when we were together, even for whole weekends and week-long holidays, she hid her heavy drinking. Employment: She has an office job and her drinking doesn\u2019t affect her work yet, as she currently only drinks at night.  Education: Not a Feminazi or (total) Libtard despite studying English Literature, Religious studies, Film studies &amp; Women\u2019s studies in College.  Trauma: Her ex-fianc\u00e9e drank a lot and encouraged her too, they had a surprise pregnancy, 6 months in she had a miscarriage, the coward emptied the apartment of his stuff and bailed while she was recovering in hospital, he never returned her calls. &gt;I love her for all the reasons that aren&#039;t listed above.

The move came out before 2007 (or maybe 2006) and is a horror film. The basis was that an monster in a old crate (possibly gold cant remember) was being transferred somewhere by ship.

There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3.

Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "702281634"}, {"teaser": "So, I usually go here to post my new crappy and downright shitty YouTube videos (I have a special event week, so I&#039;m posting every freaking day).

This time, though, I would like to just explain the shit, because, well, maybe it will being a few viewers who would actually like what I do. So we were filming this crappy half-an-hour pilot for 4 long years: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovZCHpKNcm4 Not that it&#039;s something big, because producing a feature on no budget is taking 5+ (nearly full 10 if you count from the start of writing the script). Still, one of the most grueling editing processes I had, which took months of work and two nearly full nights and days before the release assembling the final cut, then re-editing it slightly and translating/subtitling (it is in Russian and English with respective inverted subtitles). Subtitling went slightly wrong near the end, but I was too exhausted to notice and left it as is (result: a few typing errors and a downright shameful grammatical one for a guy who&#039;s a professional translator). Why am I writing this? I hope there&#039;s something there who as well tried for years to do something and probably stopped, because he thought that no one needs it.

Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don&#039;t think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?

ICANN currently operates under US law which means free speech is currently protected on the internet.  &gt;What does this mean? When Obama gives away the internet on October first, ICANN will allow countries, people, corporations, or basically anyone to buy stakes. These stakes give them power over the internet, for example Mohammed could buy out a stake and decide they want to censor anything with insulting Islam. From then on, anti-islamic speech would be banned on the internet, even in the US. &gt;Why do I care? One of the first sites they will go for is 4chan, specifically /pol/ and /b/.

What I&#039;m trying to get at here is that I completely avoided getting any sort of social life and basically turned to interactions online in my spare time, 16 hours a day, and way before you morons were doing it. My mentality (morals and kinks especially) just got worse, got more and more &quot;diverse&quot; and harder and harder.

Or anything else i can do?", "threadId": "702333493"}, {"teaser": "Comfy movies", "threadId": "702333496"}, {"teaser": "Cringe thread. post only the cringiest stuff", "threadId": "702333497"}, {"teaser": "Beta uprising, /b/itches.", "threadId": "702333503"}, {"teaser": "This thread is dedicated to those who have trouble with women.

The bus security video shows Tavon Walters assaulting the 5-year-old girl, leaving a visible handprint on her face documented in the photograph by her parents. Because of the video footage, police have charged Walters with assaulting the little girl, but Bamberg County (South Carolina) Schools Superintendent Phyllis Schwarting doesn&#039;t believe the mark came from the bus assault. &quot;The behavior on the bus was not any more, I mean, abnormal than on most buses,&quot; commented Superintendent Phyllis Schwarting about the bus assault video. Parents want to know why a convicted criminal on probation for previous crimes with a history of violence was even allowed on the bus with 5-year-old children. Why is Phyllis Schwarting being allowed to get away with not punishing, or even admitting, that this young man with a criminal record assaulting a defenseless little girl on a school bus is wrong? The child is now afraid to ride the bus again. Is this White guilt? Black Lives Matter?

There is a price on our sin\u2015eternal death in Hell. The Lake of Fire Revelation 20:15, &quot;And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.\u201d 3.

Through faith ALONE we are immediately saved. John 6:28-29, \u201cThen said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d John 14:6, \u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d", "threadId": "702338745"}, {"teaser": "sup /b/ how the fuck did this happen?", "threadId": "702338801"}, {"teaser": "Is there any way to make my internet really good?

My ma has some health issues, so I buy water for my family so she doesn&#039;t have to lift it.

I go buy the water and some groceries for myself and drive back to the house. The front door is open, I walk in and I don&#039;t see anybody. I yell for my mother, nobody answers. I go into the cellar, nobody there, I go up to the first floor, second floor and third floor, nobody in sight.I called out for her on every floor and took a look around. At this point I was freaking out a little, she has an issue with her heart and I was afraid that she stayed at the house when the tenants left to inspect the building progress and collapsed or sth. I walk back down to the second floor and decide to call her to find out where she is. I ring up her number from my previous calls and an automated message with a weird accent tells me that I dialed the wrong number. I&#039;m just like wtf and try again as I&#039;m walking down the steps to the first floor. My ma answers after the second ring. I ask her where she is, she says in the house. I tell her that&#039;s BS because I just walked through the entire house and she&#039;s not there. She tells me she&#039;s on the second floor with the tenants. So I walk back up the stairs to call her out and there they are, my ma with her phone in hand and the tenants, right on the spot where I tried to call her 10 seconds ago. The outgoing call is listed on my phone but not on hers and the entire house was dead silent as I walked up. I don&#039;t drink, I don&#039;t do drugs and I don&#039;t have any mental issues.
