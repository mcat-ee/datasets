To honor the brave hero Harambe, killed while doing the one thing he loved, we must give him a just reward for his bravery and heroics. I, and Americans all across the United States in their hearts, believe that an ideal service would be to have him posthumously elected as the 45th president of the USA, moving the current nominees to the 46th.

She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could eat in comfort again. I don&#039;t think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the McDonald&#039;s restaurant or drive through, but that is another story. I went to McDonald&#039;s for dinner tonight and got a McChicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. As I was driving to the second window the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked, &#039;why don&#039;t you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot where it is cold&#039;. That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don&#039;t want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy. Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don&#039;t think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?

It&#039;s old Creed Bratton coming at your again, here from my perch as a Quality Assurance Manager at Dunder Mifflin paper. Just a few observations on the world around me.   What do you guys think is the best kind of car? To me, you can&#039;t beat motorcycles. They&#039;re small, and dangerous.   I got into a car accident yesterday and I just took off. It didn&#039;t look too bad. The guy was making a big deal out of it, but come on - dogs don&#039;t live forever.   Sometimes when I&#039;m sick, or feeling blue, I drink vinegar. I like all kinds: balsamic, vodka, orange juice, leaves.   Working in an office is fine, but I&#039;d rather be a millionaire. [Elaborate on this. It&#039;s interesting. Maybe Trademark it, too.]   Today in my office where I work as Director of Quality Assurance, we went to the beach for some reason that was never adequately explained. When we were there, our manager told us to eat hot coals. I thought that was a little bit untoward so I ate a fish. Then a woman I have literally never seen before in my entire life started talking very loudly about something involving Halpert. She was agitated, I&#039;d say. From what I could guess, she was definitely on drugs of some kind, perhaps cocaine, or maybe &#039;drines. Also, she is a knock-out. She reminds me of a young Daphne Du Maurier. Also, I stupidly ate the fishbones. I told myself &quot;never again&quot; after the last time, but then you turn around, and bam, they&#039;re in my mouth. I also ate 55 hot dogs in 15 minutes, which is a world record.   Everybody remembers: &quot;April showers bring May flowers.&quot; But no one remembers how the rest of that goes. Which I find so frustrating.   Prediction: the Orioles will win the World Series over the Pirates in seven games.   Prediction: the space program will be renamed the Outer Space Program by 2060.   Prediction: someday we will be able to travel faster than sound. We will &quot;break the sound barrier.&quot;", "threadId": "702150740"}, {"teaser": "What in the actual fuck.

Oh my god I have no idea what to do. My dad walked in on me masturbating. He didn\u2019t see very much but I had no pants on. All I had was a tank top and socks. The worst part was that I was masturbaiting with a cucumber from the kitchen and I had my legs spread all the way apart! I was looking down at the cucumber and I didn\u2019t even hear him open the door. Just all of a sudden I hear him yell \u2018Ali!\u2019 It scared the crap out of me! Then he\u2019s like \u2018that\u2019s not what we use those cucumbers for!\u2019 and I was so embarrassed that my face was like burning red! I apologized and took the cucumber out my hand and started to hand it to him and he\u2019s like \u2018I don\u2019t want it, it\u2019s yours now\u2019. I was so nervous I couldn\u2019t even think straight! Then he started lecturing me about how it\u2019s insanity to masturbate with vegetables and telling me that a cucumber is way too big for a person my age! And how it\u2019s going to make my a** loose. And the whole time I was just standing there with no pants on covering my privates with one hand and holding the cucumber in the other hand. And I\u2019m looking at the cucumber in the corner of my eye and it\u2019s all white and sticky from being in my a** and I\u2019m trying to cover it up but I can\u2019t because I only have one free hand and my dad keeps looking at it and I can tell he can see the a** goo all over it and I\u2019m like totally humiliated. I feel as if im about to pass out. Then after like 5 mins of talking to me he says \u2018you can buy your own vegetables now with your pocket money\u2019 and I said \u2018ok dad\u2019.

You know why I hate niggers? It&#039;s not because of their skin color, because that would be stupid, no, it&#039;s because they are evolutionary throwbacks.  Think about it. As we developed as a species, the more intelligent of us started to explore the world because of higher I.Q. s which led to intellectual curiosity. As time progressed those people evolved into other races and started to build modern civilization. Meanwhile niggers sat content to wallow in their own nignorance and graze in fields like the dumb fucking animals they are. The worst thing an advanced civilization could do is let these fucking chimps in because they contribute nothing and breed like cockroaches.  Bringing these fucks to North America was the worst thing anyone could have done and now we&#039;re seeing the end result. They drain resources and add nothing of worth to our societies. Go to any major city in the USA, look at it today then compare it to the way it was 50-60 years ago. Look at everything we built and then look at the ruins left today as these knuckle dragging fucking Neanderthals drag our world back into the dark ages. I envy people who are in their 70&#039;s as they got to see our civilization at its peak and don&#039;t have to live much longer to see it go further into the fucking shitter because of niggers, SJW&#039;s, cucks and fags.  And why is it that for all their posturing, &quot;you mad, whiteboy?&quot; etc..., every single one of them aspires to fuck/impregnate white women? It&#039;s because they know their race is worthless and hope that they can have successful offspring by giving their larva a genetic leg up by mixing with some white bitch thus diluting their inferior genes. If this wasn&#039;t true, niggers would only breed with black bitches and shun other races.

SPOILERS FOR THE BOOK BELOW YOU STUPID NIGGERS I had always heard about the movie but I never really got interested in pursuing it so a friend suggested I read the book. I got the book a couple days ago and found it to be a real page turner. Learning Nadsat was really horroshow I felt like i was really getting immersed in this world where teens have no traditional morals roam the streets at night being fucking savages. i had never really pondered the meaning of the title until I read the book, I always thought of it as two words without meaning. Our little Alex was a sick fiend but is being a sick fiend wrong? Or is being forced into not being a sick fiend wrong? The whole book has this morally ambiguous tone throughout that reminds me of Watchmen and Deus Ex. To be a bit topical you could even relate this to Tay AI and that cal that happened a few months ago. The &quot;modification&quot; bits reminded me of a rekt thread and how every once in awhile I&#039;ll hop in one and smeck at that kid getting his fingers stuck in the escalator railing and falling off. That kind of scared me, the relation between those two instances. I&#039;ve always been a morally gray person, I am pretty selfish and I probably won&#039;t bother to help a chelloveck leaking red krovvy in the gutter unless I thought I could get a lifetime movie and royalties, though I&#039;m still young and perhaps that will change with age.

I had a heat treatment done about a month ago (which cost over $1000 for ONE bedroom) and so far I havn&#039;t seen anything except a couple bites a few days after the treatment. I&#039;m not religious, but just in case there IS a higher power, I have said prayers for relief from this situation a few times. This shit is a nightmare. No sleep. When you do sleep you wake up constantly, terrified you&#039;ll find something crawling around (which I have before). Flashlight constantly by your side, and ruining your lungs by breathing in diatomaceous earth because that&#039;s the only effective thing you can afford. Work suffers because you&#039;re constantly tired, you can&#039;t bring any family or anybody else over to your house because you&#039;re terrified of spreading them. Sleeping in the shower doesn&#039;t seem like such a bad idea anymore. I&#039;ve thought of temporarily poisoning myself (similar to how we do it for dogs or cats that have fleas). I&#039;ve thought of moving, but that risks taking them with me. I&#039;ve thought of killing myself just for peace. All of this because of something smaller than my bitten and chipped fingernails. Nobody I talk to gets it, either. Nobody knows how to deal with them, because the problem is still pretty new to the US. Bed bugs are resistant to most over the counter pesticides, and they&#039;re tiny and love to live in the walls of your house. I found them in my car, as well. All I can do is wait. And hope.

They weren&#039;t as rampant. Most of the content was shitty as it is today. Only real difference is that there wasn&#039;t banana. &gt;Trap threads. Existed. Weren&#039;t permanently on the front page.  &gt;OC There was a shitload of arguing over whether 4chan stole content and took credit for making things from Ebaums and Newgrounds and the other way around, but honestly the traffic for all of them had a bunch of the same people so it didn&#039;t really fuckin matter. (Later found out ebaums was a complete load of shit. We were right faggots) &gt;Mods This is the one thing I&#039;d say has really changed. The mods were a lot more active than just banning people or removing a post. You&#039;d see mods posting like once a week and everybody would go kiss their ass or fuck with em. Now mods are basically janitors with powers. &gt;cancer It always had cancer threads and posts. There were always terrible trolls, dead copypastas, shitty b8 posts, and plain shitposting. &gt;Anime There was a lot more anime shit around. It was originally supposed to be an anime image board so yeah. Kinda died off. &gt;The big MLP explosion Jesus Christ it was catastrophic. Some asshat posts an obvious baitpost with a pony image, the thread goes apeshit, 5 more repeat. If you think that furries need their own board because there are s/g/whatever fur threads, it&#039;s nothing compared to winter 2010.  &gt;Muh normie invasion No shit there are more normal people here now than there used to be.

There needs to be alot more love in this world. At a time when the governments of the world envoke fear and hatred in the people, and the media tells us what we need to buy or have in order to be happy. At a time when so much hatred and hardship strains the people of the world I feel things are missing. Compassion, love, kindness, respect for fellow human beings. I just want you to know no matter who you are, what the color of your skin is, your gender identity, your sexual orientation, your race. no matter how you were born, regardless of the regrets of your past, the mistakes you&#039;ve made, the damage that you may have done to yourself, or others.  I want you to know that I love you, and you are capable of whatever you can think of. You are a beautiful person, and you have just as much right to your happiness and your freedom as anyone else.  We&#039;re all living on this planet together, and I refuse to let my one life go wasted on furthering hatred in such a crucial time in human history. I love each and every one of you, I will support you all no matter what you do. and I believe in each person reading this post. If youre having a bad night, know that someone out there cares for you. I care for you. Good people still exist in this world. Surround yourself with positivity and love and you&#039;re entire outlook on life change.  Stay amazing, you beautiful wonderful people.

I&#039;ve just discovered the guide to a ritual that is suppose to bring power to the performer, but it requires a huge amount of human sacrifices so here&#039;s what I&#039;m going to do. I remember when I was a kid that there&#039;d be like 50-100 people showing up at my grandmother&#039;s church every sunday, and the property for the church was huge. The guide for the ritual states that I need a large circle like the one in pic related, each point needs to be adorned with a large metal obelisk. The center of the circle is where the sacrifices are, and the person receiving the power stands at the opening. So what if I were to become a minister, build the obelisks myself, and then sacrifice my entire congregation in exchange for an amount of energy directly proportionate to their stored energy? It would be super easy to do. Everyone inside the center of the circle dies and is basically turned into dust as the electrons that bind their atoms together are literally ripped away from them and converted into raw power that is given to whoever is standing at the opening of the circle.

These fuckers get scared and start busting out the windows and the doors, only one guy remains. Some asian dude I&#039;ve never met or ever seen in my life. This dude was sitting in front of the computer doing fuck know&#039;s what and I tell him there&#039;s no rush he can finish his shit nobody&#039;s got any beef with him. Suddenly a large group of criminal looking dudes walk in the apartment ( the room me and the asian dude we&#039;re in). I&#039;m looking at them and start wondering who the fuck these guys are and what are they doing here. Suddenly this mexican/Pablo Escobar looking motherfucker walks up to me and says something on the line : I want this asian motherfucker to tattoo our gang with drawings like the tattoo&#039;s i&#039;ve got. I tell him: You have no idea, since this guy didn&#039;t put any ink on me. Then he starts staring me down with a crazy psycho looking face and grabs me in a hold. I&#039;m not panicking , i&#039;m curious about the fuckers intent and ask him: What now? He says: I have to throw you out the fuckin&#039; window, there is no other way. Still no fear or panic on my side, then I look back to the doorway and see my dad staring this motherfucker down like the Terminator. I ask him : Destroy this fucker? , he immediately responds firmly: Lets. We start bashing this motherfucker like he was a piece of meat and kept at it until nothing is left of him but a piece of flesh with skin on his skull, unrecognizable. Then we stop and look at it and watch it as it tries to regenerate like the Thing from Carpenter&#039;s movie.

There are apparently cyanobacteria that are converting nuclear radiation from sites near Chernobyl into biological energy.

SPOILERS FOR THE BOOK BELOW YOU STUPID NIGGERS I had always heard about the movie but I never really got interested in pursuing it so a friend suggested I read the book. I got the book a couple days ago and found it to be a real page turner. Learning Nadsat was really horroshow I felt like i was really getting immersed in this world where teens have no traditional morals roam the streets at night being fucking savages. i had never really pondered the meaning of the title until I read the book, I always thought of it as two words without meaning. Our little Alex was a sick fiend but is being a sick fiend wrong? Or is being forced into not being a sick fiend wrong? The whole book has this morally ambiguous tone throughout that reminds me of Watchmen and Deus Ex. To be a bit topical you could even relate this to Tay AI and that cal that happened a few months ago. The &quot;modification&quot; bits reminded me of a rekt thread and how every once in awhile I&#039;ll hop in one and smeck at that kid getting his fingers stuck in the escalator railing and falling off. That kind of scared me, the relation between those two instances. I&#039;ve always been a morally gray person, I am pretty selfish and I probably won&#039;t bother to help a chelloveck leaking red krovvy in the gutter unless I thought I could get a lifetime movie and royalties, though I&#039;m still young and perhaps that will change with age.
